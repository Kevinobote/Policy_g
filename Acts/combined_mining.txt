2The Mining (Royalty Collection and Management) Regulations, 2024 (Legal Notice 106 of 2024)  Kenya
6.Determination of royalty base
(1) The royalty base shall be determined for each quantity of mineral that is extracted under a mineral
right within a royalty period and—
(a) that is transported from the licence or permit area during that royalty period if it was not
previously accounted for in a royalty base calculation; or

(2) The value of the royalty base for a mineral shall be the full market value of all mineral products
capable of being produced from the mineral and that are saleable.
(3) The value of the royalty base for a particular mineral shall be equal to the full market value of all
products that can be sold and produced from that mineral.
(4) Where no reference price is available for a mineral product, the full market value shall be
determined by—
(a) subtracting the cost of producing end products from the mineral (netback value) from the
reference price of commercially producible end products from the mineral; and
(b) incorporating all costs associated with the mineral product (cost-plus value) into the value of
the mineral product:
Provided that any cost requiring allocation is assigned in such a way that it is not claimed in

different mineral products; and
(c) if there is a difference between the netback value and cost-plus value, taking the average of
the two.
(5) Where there is insufﬁcient information to enable the Director of Mines to determine the royalty
base for the holder of a mineral right for a royalty period under subregulation (4), the Director
of Mines shall determine the royalty base using the information available at the time of the
determination.
7.Royalty base for export minerals
The royalty base for minerals for export shall be the value of the mineral at the port of exit that shall

Where the Director of Mines is satisﬁed that a mineral won under a particular mineral right is to be used or
consumed exclusively within Kenya, the Director may permit the method for the calculation of the royalty
base may be adjusted as follows—
(a) for minerals transported from the area of the mineral right and sold directly at the extraction site
(mine gate or ex-factory), the sale price may serve as the basis for the royalty calculation; and
(b) using the sale price at which the mineral is delivered, if it is sold at delivery after being moved away
from the area of the mineral right, deductions or offsets shall not be allowed.
9.Royalty rates

1.Overview
Title, date and authors: The report cover and/or inner page should include a suitable title and other
information including: area name; county in which licence or permit is located; licence or permit number;
name of licence or permit holder; name of operator (if different to holder); report type (e.g. Annual,

Final);author(s); reporting period; and date of report. It may be helpful to add a company report reference
number.
Position, name and signature of author.
2.Contents
A contents page giving a breakdown, section by section, including appendices, together with page
numbers. It should list tables, ﬁgures and maps including any loose maps contained in a sleeve at the back
of the report or in a separate volume. Where a report comprises more than a single volume, each volume
should be numbered and subtitled. Each should have its own contents page which should additionally refer
to the other volumes.
3.Executive summary
The report should contain a summary (abstract) of the work carried out and the results obtained aimed
at the competent, non-specialist. The executive summary would not normally exceed three pages. Where
there is more than one volume, the executive summary to the main volume should cover all reports.
4.Introduction
General background to project.
5.Geological setting
This section should provide an overview of the geology based on previous work by the Geological Survey,
the licence or permit holder or others. It would normally include an outline of the stratigraphy, structure,
known mineralisation, and prospectivity of the area.
The topography and physiology should be brieﬂy described. (Note: It is not necessary to repeat all of this
information in the second and subsequent years of the licence or permit, although a short summary might
be helpful).
6.Previous exploration
Where previous prospecting has been carried out over all or part of the area (or in areas of comparable
geology nearby), the report should summarise this work (and quote references). In the second and
subsequent years, only the previous work done by the current holder is necessary. Where this is a ﬁnal
report, that is the licence or permit is being surrendered, this section must provide a summary of the work
carried out since the licence or permit was ﬁrst granted.
7.Strategy
Brieﬂy describe the target mineralisation and the exploration strategy.
Logistics: Equipment employed, staff involved (expatriate and local), access and dealings with land owners
or lawful occupiers should be summarised.
The following is a checklist of possible items to be included: the list is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive. In
general, an annual reports should mirror the contents of the approved work programme.
