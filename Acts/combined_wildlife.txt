FIFTH SCHEDULE [s. 44]
MANAGEMENT PLANS
Part I - GENERAL
52Wildlife Conservation and Management Act (Cap. 376)  Kenya
(1) A management plan is the instrument in which all the ingredients for active management are described,
in particular which organizations will undertake what responsibilities and what actions are intended to
achieve what ends. However, despite being a primary tool, management plans often go unused because of
a failure to see management plans as a dynamic working document requiring annual updates and because
of a tendency to be over elaborate.
(2) The level of planning should be tailored to the capacities of the agencies and communities involved.
Management planning should be a practical tool - one that can be created in simple form and built upon
over time, using progress reports.
(3) A management plan process includes the production of an annual compliance report and a 5 year third-
party management report.
Part 2 - PLANNING FRAMEWORK
(1) The following are information that should be included as a minimum—
• a legal description of the area covered (whether national, provincial, local or some other designation). A
legal description may include or ofﬁcially recognize customary land boundaries and/or natural boundaries
(e.g. rivers, river basins, mountain ranges, etc.);
• a brief statement of the wildlife management goals and objectives;
• the time period for which the plan is valid;
• the species covered by the plan;
• a description of habitat types, amounts, and plant composition (where possible);
• A description of the activities being undertaken;
• A report detailing the participation of neighbouring communities in the preparation of the plan;
• A description of the anticipated beneﬁts and beneﬁciaries.
(2) As the complexity of the protected area increases in terms of size, habitats, species, proposed activities,
then the following incremental information should be included for non-consumptive utilization—
• the provision of zones and the management objectives for each zone;
• the identiﬁcation of tourist carrying capacities;
• the quality targets to be met in terms of price and volume;
• the provision of tourist management regulations;
• the provisions for the management of habitats and species (particularly important in ‘closed’
ecosystems;
• the management of migratory species;
• the identiﬁcation of key breeding areas;
• the management of potential conﬂict with neighbouring communities;
• the scale and location of any infrastructural development;
• the monitoring to be undertaken and its frequency;
• any relevant historical information.
(3) And for consumptive utilization, the following information should be additionally included:
• data on historical wildlife culling, cropping, hunting, where such information is available;
• an approved method for determining sustainable off take levels; and
53Wildlife Conservation and Management Act (Cap. 376)  Kenya
• proof of compliance with the Eleventh Schedule and any other legal requirement set out in this Act.
