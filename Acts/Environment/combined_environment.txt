1.This Order may be cited as the Environmental Management (Lake Naivasha Management Plan) Order.
2.The Management Plan set out in the Schedule shall be applicable to the Lake Naivasha Ecosystem.
SCHEDULE
THE LAKE NAIVASHA MANAGEMENT PLAN
The Lake Naivasha Management Plan (hereinafter referred to as "the Plan") is a community-based initiative,
spear-headed by the local community and supported by other stakeholders and institutions with common
concerns and commitment to the sustainable management and development of the lake ecosystem.
The Plan has been developed to ensure that adverse impacts on the lake ecosystem are minimized and corrected
while addressing identiﬁed conservation issues for which there is a large degree of consensus.
The Plan shall be implemented by a special committee known as the Lake Naivasha Management Committee
(hereinafter referred to as "the Committee"), comprising key stakeholders and institutions through the
development and implementation of sectoral codes of conduct in consultation with various sectors. The
Committee shall ensure adoption of, and compliance with the codes of conduct.
The Plan emphasises that all developments within the declared Lake Naivasha Ramsar Site and the lake’s
catchment shall be subject to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), as per the provisions of the
Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act (Cap. 387).
The Plan is a dynamic tool that shall be subject to periodic reviews, depending on emerging issues and new
knowledge.
The Plan addresses sustainable management issues of the Lake Naivasha environment and the natural resources
within the declared Lake Naivasha Ramsar Site and the wider catchment as set out here below:
Water Use
The Plan shall regulate and control water use by the following measures—
(a) determination of modalities of water allocation and establishment of water use policy;

Toxic Equivalent (TEQ) is the sum of the toxic equivalent factors (TEF) of a mixture congeners contained in a
compound. The compound 2,3.7.8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-d, oxin (TCDD) was assigned a TEF of 1 after being
identiﬁed by International Association of Radiology and Cancer (IARC) and World Health Organisation (WHO),
as the most toxic of all compounds, and as carcinogenic to humans, based mainly on studies of cases involving
accidental or occupational heavy exposure therefore the TEF is a weighting factor.

PART II - Guideline on Conversion factors
(a) ppm to mg/m 3 – air
The conversion between ppm and mg/mx3 is dependent on both the molecular weight of the substance and
the temperature at which the conversion is made. The assumption is that the pollutant behaves as an ideal
37The Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Air Quality) Regulations (Legal Notice 34 of 2014)  Kenya
gas and as such, I mole of the substance occupies 22,4 litres at standard temperature (273K) and pressure
(101.3 kPa). This is consistent with normalised concentrations, and it is therefore not normally necessary
to take account of the temperature or pressure difference in the conversion. However, when converting
ppm to mg/m3 at actual discharge conditions, it is important to take account of the necessary factors.
To convert from ppm to mg/m3, the following formula should be used:
mg/m3 = ppm x (MW /22.4) x (273/T) x (P/101.3)
Where
MW is the molecular weight of the substance (in grams)
T is the temperature at which the conversion is to be made (degrees Kelvin)
P is the pressure at which the conversion is to be made (kPa)
To convert from mg/m3 to ppm, the following formulae should be used:
ppm = mg/m3 x (22.4/MW) x (T/273) x (101.3/P)
PART III - Factors to be considered when setting ambient air quality limits
These factors include:
(1) Degree of exposure of sectors of the population, and in particular sensitive subgroups.
(2) Climatic conditions and meteorology.
(3) Sensitivity of ﬂora and fauna and their habitats.
(4) Historic heritage exposed to pollutants.
(5) Transboundary movement.
PART IV - Emission Reduction Measures of Dark Smoke from Chimneys
(1) Avoid overloading burners with fuel oil.
(2) Use the correct fuel to air ratio by proper adjustment of the air and fuel supplies.
(3) Avoid ﬂame impingement on any cold surface.
(4) Avoid carbon build-up in the boiler and furnace tubes and maintain the boiler and furnace settings in good
condition.
(5) Clean the burner at regular intervals and remove the carbon deposits from the nozzle with soft article after
soaking, the noble in Kerosene.
(6) Use the correct atomizing nozzle and atomizing pressure.
(7) Check for worn or distorted Parts of the burner and replace the damaged Parts.
(8) Allow sufﬁcient time in lighting up the burners from cold and adopt the correct startup procedures as
recommended by the burner manufacturers.
(9) Keep the mesh at the inlet of the air blower clear at all times.
PART V - Guideline on emissions report format
The emissions report format shall include:—
(a) an estimate of the emissions for the relevant calendar year; and
(b) all the data applicable to the emissions sources, in respect of the licensed facility.
38The Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Air Quality) Regulations (Legal Notice 34 of 2014)  Kenya
(c) Estimates of annual emissions shall be made based on the following methods, in order of preference—
(1) continuous emission monitoring data;
(2) calculation of SO 2 emissions based on fuel use and sulphur content data including combustion
processes in which exhaust gases do not come in contact with products;

years and activity data for the year for which emissions are estimated;
(4) emission factor or equivalent methods and activity data for the year;
(5) emission factor or equivalent methods and plant capacity data;
(6) mass balance (including fuel use data) based on the two previous years or the most recent
representative year;
(7) other approved methods supported by calculation and documentation, and the procedures set out
in the guideline document.
PART VI - Measures or operating procedures to control fugitive emissions
The following measures or operating procedures may be used to control fugitive emissions:—
(a) from storage piles through use of enclosures, covers or stabilisation, minimising the slope of the upwind
face of the pile, conﬁning as much pile activity as possible to the downwind side of the pile and such other
methods or techniques as are approved by the Authority;
(b) by enclosing, covering, watering, or otherwise treating loaded haul trucks and railroad cars, or limiting
size of loads, to minimise loss of material to wind and spillage;
(c) by minimising the area of disturbed land or tailings;
(d) by planting special wind break vegetation at critical points;
(e) by prompt removal of coal, rock minerals, soil, and other dust-forming debris from paved roads and
scraping and compaction of unpaved roads to stabilise the road surface as often as necessary to minimise
re-entrainment of fugitive Particulate matter from the road surface;
(f)by minimising the period of time between initially disturbing the soil and re-vegetating or other surface;
(g) by restricting the areas to be blasted at any one time;
(h) by restricting the speed of vehicles in or around mining, tailing or quarrying operations;
(i) by re-vegetating, mulching, or otherwise stabilising the surface of all areas adjoining roads that are a
source of fugitive Particulate emissions;
(j) by substituting covered conveyor systems for haul trucks;
(k) by using synthetic or re-vegetative covers;
(l) by restricting vehicular travel to established paved roads;
(m) by watering or chemical stabilisation of unpaved roads as often as necessary to minimise re-entrainment
of fugitive Particulate matter from the road surface, or paving of roads.
Where "fugitive emission" means an emission that cannot or is not reasonably likely to pass through a
stack, chimney, vent or other functionally equivalent opening.
PART VII - Opacity Measurement Guidelines
The darkness of smoke is determined by comparing the shade of smoke to the shades on a Ringelmann Chart
which consists of four squares with grids, which denoted shade 1 to shade 4. The darkness covered in each
of these four squares represents twenty percent, fourty percent, sixty percent and eighty percent opacity
39The Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Air Quality) Regulations (Legal Notice 34 of 2014)  Kenya
respectively. Ringelmann shade 0 is completely white and shade 5 is totally black. Therefore, Ringelmann shade 1
corresponds to smoke of twenty percent opacity.
The regulations stipulate that dark smoke emission from any chimney or relevant plant must not exceed:—
(i) 8 minutes in any period of four hours; or
(ii) 3 minutes continuously at any one time.
PART VIII - Guideline on sources of fugitive emission air pollutants
The following are the sources of fugitive emissions:—
(a) construction activities;
(b) storage and handling, including loading and unloading, of materials such as bauxite, alumina, gypsum, or
Portland cement or the raw materials therefore;
(c) mining and quarrying activities;
(d) haul roads;
(e) haul trucks;
(f)tailings piles and ponds;

STANDARDS, GUIDELINES, CRITERIA, PROCEDURE FOR INSTALLING/OPERATING INCINERATORS
No. Parameter Standards, Guideline, Criteria and Procedure
14The Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Waste Management) Regulations (Legal Notice 121
of 2006)  Kenya
1 Basic Plant Design An approved plant must have four distinct sections that demonstrate
three principles of turbulence, residence, time and temperature are
inbuilt in the plant design. The regulated sections may include but are
not limited to:
• Overall plant layout;
• Feed chamber/charging;
• Primary Combustion Chamber;
• Secondary Combustion Chamber;
• Particulate Scrubbers;
• Acid Gas Scrubbers;
• The stack/chimney.
2 Feeding and Charging Controlled hygienic, mechanical or automatic feeding methods have to
be used which will not inﬂuence the air temperature in the primary and
secondary chambers of the incinerator negatively.
No waste is to be fed into the incinerator:
1. Until the minimum temperatures have been reached;
2. If the minimum combustion temperatures are not maintained;
3. Whenever the previous charge has not been completely combusted in
the case of batch feeding;
4. Until such time as the addition of more waste will not cause the
design parameters of the incinerator to be exceeded.
3Primary Combustion
ChamberThe primary combustion chamber must:
1. be accepted as the primary combustion zone;
2. be equipped with a burner/s burning gas/fuel or low sulphur liquid
fuels. Other combustion methods will be judged on merits;
3. ensure primary air supply is controlled efﬁciently;
4. ensure minimum exit temperature is not less than 850°C.
15The Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Waste Management) Regulations (Legal Notice 121
of 2006)  Kenya
4Secondary
Combustion Chamber
(Afterburner).The secondary combustion chamber must:
1. be accepted as secondary combustion zone;
2. be ﬁtted with secondary burner/s burning gas or low sulphur liquid
fuel or any suitable fuel;
3. ensure secondary air supply is controlled efﬁciently;
4. ensure ﬂame contact with all gases is achieved;
5. ensure residence time is not less than two (2) seconds;
6. ensure the gas temperature as measured against the inside wall in the
secondary chamber and not in the ﬂame zone, is not less than 1100°C;
7. ensure the oxygen content of the emitted gases is not less than 11%;
8. ensure both primary and the combustion temperatures are
maintained until all waste has been completely combusted.
5Particulate RemoversA mechanical particulate collector must be incorporated after secondary
combustion chamber for removal of particulate pollutants entrained in
the ﬂue gas stream.
The particulate collectors may include any of the following or a
combination thereof:
1. cyclone separator;
2. electrostatic precipitators;
3. fabric ﬁlters.
6Chimney/Stack1. The chimney should have a minimum height of 10 meters above
ground level and clear the highest point of the building by not less than
3 meters for all roofs.
The topography and height of adjacent buildings within 50 meters radius
should be taken into account.
2. If possible the chimney should be visible to the operator from the
feeding area.
3. The addition of dilution air after combustion in order to achieve the
requirement of these guidelines is unacceptable.
4. The minimum exit velocity should be 10 m/s and at least twice the
surrounding wind speed (Efﬂux velocity = wind speed x 2) whichever is
higher to ensure no down washing of exiting gases.
5. Point for the measurement of emissions shall be provided.
16The Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Waste Management) Regulations (Legal Notice 121
of 2006)  Kenya
7 Instrumentation 1. Instrument for determining the inside wall temperature and not

required.
• A carbon monoxide and/or oxygen meter/recorder.
• A smoke density meter/recorder.
• A gas ﬂow meter/recorder.
• A solid particulate meter/recorder.
Any other instrument or measurement that may be considered
necessary.
8 Location/Siting 1. Must be sited in accordance with the relevant local municipal
authority planning scheme, the topography of the area and be
compatible with premises in the neighbourhood.
2. Must be housed in a suitably ventilated room.
9 Emission Limits 1. Combustion efﬁciency:
Combustion efﬁciency (CE) shall be at least 99.00%; The Combustion
efﬁciency is computed as follows;
C.E = % CO2 x 100
% CO2+ CO
2. The temperature of the primary chamber shall be 800 ± 50°C.
3. The secondary chamber gas residence time shall be at least 1 (one)
second at 1050 ± 50°C, with 3% oxygen in the stack gas.
4. Opacity of the smoke must not exceed 20% viewed from 50 metres
with naked eyes.
5. All the emission to the air other than steam or water vapour must be
odourless and free from mist, fume and droplets.
6. The Authority may require that the certiﬁcate holder have tests
carried out by an accredited institution to determine stack and/or
ground level concentrations of the following substances.

UN
CLASSCODE CHARACTERISTICS
1 H1 Explosive
An explosive substance or waste is a solid or liquid substance or waste (or mixture
of substances or wastes) which is in itself capable by chemical reaction or producing
gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such a speed as to cause damage to the
surroundings.

of 2006)  Kenya
UN Code Characteristics Class
3 H3 Flammable Liquids
The word “ﬂammable” has the same meaning as “inﬂammable”. Flammable liquids are
liquids, or mixtures of liquids, or liquids containing solids in solution or suspension
(for example paints, varnishes, lacquers and others but not including substances or
wastes otherwise classiﬁed on account of their dangerous characteristics) which give off a
ﬂammable vapour at temperatures of not more than 60.5°C, closed-cup test, or not more
than 65.6°C open-cup test (since the results of open-cup tests and closed-up tests are
not strictly comparable and even individual results by the same tests are often variable,
regulations varying from the above ﬁgures to make allowance for such difference would be
within the spirit of this deﬁnition).
4.1 H4.1 Flammable Solids
Solids or waste solids, other than those classed as explosives, which under conditions
encountered in transport are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to ﬁre
through friction.
4.2 H4.2Substances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustion
Substance or wastes which are liable to spontaneous heating under normal conditions
encountered in transport or to heating up on tract with air, and being then liable to catch
ﬁre.
4.3 H4.3Substances or wastes which, in contact with water emit ﬂammable gases Substances or
wastes which, by interaction with water, are liable to become spontaneously ﬂammable or
give off ﬂammable gases in dangerous quantities.
5.1 H5.1Oxiding
Substances or wastes which, while in themselves not necessary combustible, may
generally, by yielding oxygen, cause or contribute to the combustion of other materials.
5.2 H5.2Organic Peroxides
Organic substances or wastes which contain the bivalent 0-0-structure are thermally
unstable substances which may undergo exothermic self accelerating decomposition.
6.1 H6.1Toxic or poisonous (Acute)
Substances or wastes liable either to cause death or serious injury to the human health if
swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact.
6.2 H6.2Infectious substances extremely hazardous to health
Substances or wastes containing viable micro-organisms or their toxins which are known
or suspected to cause disease in animals or humans.

of 2006)  Kenya
UN Code Characteristics Class
8 H8Corrosives
Substances or wastes which, by chemical action, will cause severe damage when in contact
with living tissue, or in the case of leakage will materially damage, or even destroy, other
goods in the means of transport; they may also cause other hazards.
9 H10Liberation of toxic gases in contact with air or water
Substances or wastes which by interaction with air or water, are liable to give out toxic
gases in dangerous quantities.
9 H11Toxic (delayed or chronic)
Substances or wastes which, by interaction with air or water, are liable to give out toxic
gases in dangerous quantities.
Substances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate through
the skin may involve delayed or chronic effects, including carcinogenicity.
9 H12Ecotoxic
Substances or wastes which, if released present or may present immediate or delayed
adverse impacts to the environment by means of bio-accumulation and/or toxic effects
upon biotic systems.
9 H13Capable, by means, after disposal, of yielding another material e.g. leachate which
possesses any of the characteristics listed above.
10 H14Radioactive waste
11 H15Persistent waste; waste which contaminate the environment for long periods of time.
12 H16Carcinogenic wastes which may lead to development of cancer in human beings or
animals.
