2038 (c)  unacceptable production or persistence of toxins or other undesirable products of microbial metabolism. 3.  The identified hazards must be those that their elimination or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the production of safe fish products.  4.  The multidisciplinary team shall— (a)  list all potential biological, chemical or physical hazards that are expected to occur at each step of processing (including those resulting from acquisition and storage of raw materials, ingredients, delays during processing and any other foreseeable eventuality).  (b)  consider and describe control measures, which can be applied to eliminate or reduce each hazard. 5.  In identifying the critical point for the control of the hazard, take the following steps–  (a)  ensure that appropriate control measures are effectively designed and implemented. In particular, if a hazard has been identified at a step where control is necessary for product safety and no control measure exists at that step or at any other, then the product or process shall be modified at that step, or at an earlier or later stage, to include a control measure. (b)  establish and implement a monitoring and checking system at each critical point.  F- MONITORING AND CHECKING OF CRITICAL POINTS General Principles 1.  The following steps shall be taken as the framework for the design of a suitable system for monitoring and checking critical points— Establishing Critical limits (a)  Each control measure associated with a critical point shall give rise to the specification of critical limits.  (b)  The critical limits shall correspond to the extreme values acceptable with regard to product safety. Critical points are determined for observable or measurable parameters including temperature, moisture level, additive, preservative or salt level, which can readily demonstrate whether the critical point is under control; they shall be based on substantiated evidence that the chosen values will result in elimination of the hazard. (c)  To reduce the risk of exceeding a critical limit due to naturally occurring process variations, it may be necessary to specify more stringent target levels than are necessary to eliminate the hazard, to ensure that process variable remain within the critical limits in a reasonable majority of cases. (d)  Critical limits may be derived from a variety of sources. They may be defined by regulatory standards or from existing and validated guides of good manufacturing practices. In all cases the team shall ascertain their validity relative to the control of the identified hazards at the critical points. Establishing a monitoring and checking system 1.  An essential part of internal control system is a programmed of observations or measurements performed at each critical point to ensure compliance with specified  Kenya Subsidiary Legislation, 2024 2039 
  critical limits, which describes the methods of measurement, the frequency of observation s or measurements and the recording procedures to be followed. 2.  Observations or measurement must be able to detect loss of control at critical points and provide information in sufficient time for corrective action to be taken. 3.  It is necessary to establish a frequency of observation or measurements (in terms of a defined sampling plan) which provides information which can be validly used for extrapolation of the resulting measurement data to the behavior of critical variables between observations. 4.  Any decision on the periods between observations of critical variables at critical points shall be based on a detailed knowledge of the behavior of those variables (and in particular their rate of change under all foreseeable circumstances). 5.  A written programme of observations or measurements shall properly identify for each critical point- (a)  the person monitoring and checking; (b)  the time when monitoring and checking is performed; and  (c)  how monitoring and checking is performed. 6.  Observations or measurements may indicate– (a)  that the parameter monitored is tending towards, although not exceeding its specified critical limits, indicating a tread towards loss of control Appropriate corrective action to maintain control must be taken before the occurrence of a hazards; and (b)  that the parameter monitored has exceeded its specified critical limits, indicating a loss of control and decide on an appropriate action with respect to the products subject to the process conditions exceeding the critical limits. 7.  Corrective action must be planned and documented in advance by the multidisciplinary team, for each critical point and for each of the above cases, so that the necessary action may be taken without hesitation when the event is observed. 8.  The corrective action plan shall include— (a)  proper identification of the person(s) responsible for the implementation of the corrective action; (b)  description of means and action required to correct the observed deviation; (c)  action to be taken with regard to products that have been manufactured during the period when the process was out control; and  (d)  written records of measures taken. 9.  Although sampling for laboratory analysis may be included in the monitoring and checking of critical points, this specifically does not include verifying that the end product conforms with any standards or set of products criteria either externally determined. 10.  If the system of monitoring and control of critical control points is substantially dependent on sampling and laboratory analysis, then a system of internal control  Kenya Subsidiary Legislation, 2024  
  
2040 must be applied within the laboratory to ensure that the results generated are valid and reliable, including, inter alia (a)  the preparation of a written and defined programme of instrument calibration; (b)  checking of reagent activity and concentrations; and  (c)  verification that written laboratory methods are followed. G – VERIFICATION General principles 1.  Verification refers to those actions taken for the routine confirmation that the provisions for laid down for the operation of the internal control system are being properly applied. 2.  Verification is necessary to ensure that the internal control system in routine operation is executed in the manner specified by the multi-disciplinary team.

In particular, if a hazard has been identified at a step where control is necessary for product safety and no control measure exists at that step or at any other, then the product or process shall be modified at that step, or at an earlier or later stage, to include a control measure.  Kenya Subsidiary Legislation, 2024 1055 
"(b)!establish and implement a monitoring and checking system at each critical point.  
 F— MONITORING AND CHECKING OF CRITICAL POINTS General Principles 1. The following steps shall be taken as the framework for the design of a suitable system for monitoring and checking critical points— Establishing Critical limits (a)!Each control measure associated with a critical point shall give rise to the specification of critical limits.  (b)!The critical limits shall correspond to the extreme values acceptable with regard to product safety. Critical points are determined for observable or measurable parameters including temperature, moisture level, additive, preservative or salt level, which can readily demonstrate whether the critical point is under control; they shall be based on substantiated evidence that the chosen values will result in elimination of the hazard. (c)!To reduce the risk of exceeding a critical limit due to naturally occurring process variations, it may be necessary to specify more stringent target levels than are necessary to eliminate the hazard, to ensure that process variable remain within the critical limits in a reasonable majority of cases. (d)!Critical limits may be derived from a variety of sources. They may be defined by regulatory standards or from existing and validated guides of good manufacturing practices. In all cases the team shall ascertain their validity relative to the control of the identified hazards at the critical points. Establishing a monitoring and checking system 1.!An essential part of internal control system is a programmed of observations or measurements performed at each critical point to ensure compliance with specified critical limits, which describes the methods of measurement, the frequency of observation s or measurements and the recording procedures to be followed. 2.!Observations or measurement must be able to detect loss of control at critical points and provide information in sufficient time for corrective action to be taken. 3.!It is necessary to establish a frequency of observation or measurements (in terms of a defined sampling plan) which provides information which can be validly used for extrapolation of the resulting measurement data to the behavior of critical variables between observations. 4.!Any decision on the periods between observations of critical variables at critical points shall be based on a detailed knowledge of the behavior of those variables (and in particular their rate of change under all foreseeable circumstances). 5.!A written programme of observations or measurements shall properly identify for each critical point- (a)!the person monitoring and checking; (b)!the time when monitoring and checking is performed; and   Kenya Subsidiary Legislation, 2024  
"1056 (c)!how monitoring and checking is performed. 6. Observations or measurements may indicate— (a)!that the parameter monitored is tending towards, although not exceeding its specified critical limits, indicating a tread towards loss of control Appropriate corrective action to maintain control must be taken before the occurrence of a hazards; and (b)!that the parameter monitored has exceeded its specified critical limits, indicating a loss of control and decide on an appropriate action with respect to the products subject to the process conditions exceeding the critical limits. 7. Corrective action must be planned and documented in advance by the multidisciplinary team, for each critical point and for each of the above cases, so that the necessary action may be taken without hesitation when the event is observed. 8. The corrective action plan shall include— (a)!proper identification of the person(s) responsible for the implementation of the corrective action; (b)!description of means and action required to correct the observed deviation; (c)!action to be taken with regard to products that have been manufactured during the period when the process was out control; and  (d)!written records of measures taken. 9. Although sampling for laboratory analysis may be included in the monitoring and checking of critical points, this specifically does not include verifying that the end product conforms with any standards or set of products criteria either externally determined. 10. If the system of monitoring and control of critical control points is substantially dependent on sampling and laboratory analysis, then a system of internal control must be applied within the laboratory to ensure that the results generated are valid and reliable, including, inter alia (a)!the preparation of a written and defined programme of instrument calibration; (b)!checking of reagent activity and concentrations; and  (c)!verification that written laboratory methods are followed. G — VERIFICATION General principles 1.!Verification refers to those actions taken for the routine confirmation that the provisions for laid down for the operation of the internal control system are being properly applied. 2.!Verification is necessary to ensure that the internal control system in routine operation is executed in the manner specified by the multi-disciplinary team. The multi-disciplinary team shall specify the methods and procedures to be used for the verification of the own-checks system. 3.!The person responsible for the fishery enterprise shall implement the verification programme at specified intervals. Government inspectors may also undertake a routine verification as part of any accreditation scheme.  Kenya Subsidiary Legislation, 2024 1057
