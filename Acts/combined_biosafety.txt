that serve as models for human
diseases to help scientists better
understand prevention and
treatment strategies.☐ Possession of
characteristics which
are environmentally
friendly e.g. improved use
of dietary phosphorous to
lessen the environmental
impacts of animal manure☐ In the phylogenetic analysis of the
ampliﬁed nucleic acid sequences to
provide novel information on the
evolution of pathogens.
☐ Animal vaccines rationally
designed for the speciﬁc control
and eradication of diseases,
including the implementation
of DIVA (differentiating infected
from vaccinated animals)
strategies.☐ Development of
diagnostic kits that can
not only be used in the
laboratory but pen-side
tests that can be used in
the ﬁeld to make decisions
about the exposure of
animals during a disease
outbreak.☐ In epidemiology to characterize
pathogens through determination of
their nucleotide sequence. The possibility
of pinpointing the source of infection
can signiﬁcantly contribute to improved
disease control.
33The Biosafety (Contained Use) Regulations (Legal Notice 96 of 2011)  Kenya

indigenous species that are
near extinction, including
intra-species nuclear
transfer procedures which
can be used to rescue genes
from endangered species.☐ New and improved medicines for
animals. e.g. Gene therapy which involves
the insertion of a functional gene or
another molecule that contains an
information sequence into a cell to
achieve a therapeutic effect. Thus, the
gene serves as a drug.
☐ Producing large amounts
of therapeutic - proteins in
animal milk or meat (biopharm
animals or transgenic animal
bioreactors) may be an efﬁcient,
relatively low cost method to
manufacture many proteins
used to treat human diseases
or proteins that have industrial
value.☐ In the development of
novel diagnostic assays,
e.g. PCR and isothermal
ampliﬁcation methods,
microarrays, protein
detection by nucleic acid
ampliﬁcation, recombinant
proteins, synthetic proteins,
biosensors etc. to detect
the pathogens and/or the
immune responses after
infection.☐ Other (Specify)

1.Citation
These Regulations may be cited as the Biosafety (Labelling) Regulations.
2.Interpretation
In these Regulations unless the context otherwise requires—
"altered characteristic" of a genetically modiﬁed food means that when the genetically modiﬁed food is
compared to its conventional counterpart, it is different in:
composition or nutritional values, anti-nutritional factors or natural toxicants, factors known to cause
allergic responses in particular sections of the population, its intended use, or any other material
differences;
"Authority" means the National Biosafety Authority established under section 5 of the Act;
"competent authority" means an agency of a country outside Kenya responsible under its national law for
the control or regulation of genetically modiﬁed organisms;
"conventional counterpart" means a related organism or variety, its components or products for which
there is experience of establishing safety based on common use as food, feed or for processing;
"food, feed or ingredient derived from genetically modiﬁed organism" means a food, feed, or ingredient
produced, in whole or in part from genetically modiﬁed organisms;
"genetic modiﬁcation-free" means the complete absence of any genetically modiﬁed material, or use of a
genetic modiﬁcation process, in a food or food product and
"non-genetically modiﬁed organism" shall be construed accordingly;
"genetically modiﬁed food or feed" means food or feed that is, or contains as an ingredient, including a
processing aid, produced using modern biotechnology which—
(a) contains novel DNA or novel protein; or
1The Biosafety (Labelling) Regulations (Legal Notice 40 of 2012)  Kenya
(b) has altered characteristics;
"genetically modiﬁed organism" means an organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic
material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology techniques;
"labeling" means any written, printed, or graphic matter that accompanies a food or is displayed near the
food, including that for the purpose of promoting its sale or disposal;
"novel DNA or novel protein" means DNA or a protein which, as a result of the use of genetic modiﬁcation,
is different in chemical sequence or structure from DNA or protein present in counterpart food which has
not been produced using genetic modiﬁcation;
"operator" means a natural or legal person who places a product on the market at any stage of the
production and distribution chain, but does not include the ﬁnal consumer;
"placing on the market" means making a genetically modiﬁed organism available for sale;
"product" means genetically modiﬁed food, feed and ingredients as deﬁned under these Regulations;
"traceability" means the ability to trace genetically modiﬁed organisms and products of genetically
modiﬁed organisms at all stages of their placing on the market through the production and distribution
chains;
"unique identiﬁer" means a simple numeric or alphanumeric code which serves to identify a genetically
modiﬁed organism on the basis of the authorized transformation event from which it was developed and
providing the means to retrieve speciﬁc information pertinent to that genetically modiﬁed organism.
3.Objective
The objective of these Regulations is—
(a) to ensure that consumers are made aware that food, feed or a product is genetically modiﬁed so that
they can make informed choices; and
(b) to facilitate the traceability of genetically modiﬁed organism products to assist in the
implementation of appropriate risk management measures where necessary.
4.Application
The labelling requirements shall include, but not be limited to—
(a) products consisting of, or containing, genetically modiﬁed organisms; or
(b) food or feed produced from genetically modiﬁed organisms, placed on the market in accordance
with the Act.
5.Exemptions
These Regulations shall not apply to—
(a) food, feed or their ingredients containing approved genetically modiﬁed organisms and derived
products where there is inadvertent presence of genetically modiﬁed material in proportions of less
than 1% of the total weight;
(b) highly reﬁned food, where the effect of the reﬁning process is to remove novel DNA or novel
protein;
(c) a processing aid or food additive, except where novel DNA or novel protein from the processing aid
or food additive remains present in the food to which it has been added above the threshold level;
(d) food intended for consumption prepared and sold from food premises and vendors.
2The Biosafety (Labelling) Regulations (Legal Notice 40 of 2012)  Kenya
6.Food safety assessment before labelling
Labelling and packaging of food, feed or ingredients containing genetically modiﬁed organisms or
products derived from genetically modiﬁed organisms shall be considered after they have undergone
appropriate food safety assessment in accordance with the Act.
7.Labelling and packaging requirements
(1) In labelling products consisting of or containing genetically modiﬁed organisms, operators shall
ensure that—
(a) for pre-packaged products, the words "genetically modiﬁed (name of ingredient)" or
"genetically modiﬁed (name of food)" appears on the label;
(b) for non-pre-packaged products the words "genetically modiﬁed organisms" or "genetically
modiﬁed (name of organism)" shall appear on, or in connection with, the display of the
product.
(2) In addition to the inclusion of the words "genetically modiﬁed" as required under subregulation (1),
there shall be additional labelling and information requirements for genetically modiﬁed foods that
have altered characteristics in relation to—
(a) one or more signiﬁcant composition or nutritional parameters having values outside the
normal range of values compared to conventional counterpart food or feed or ingredient
thereof not produced using modern biotechnology techniques;
(b) the level of anti-nutritional factors or natural toxicants that are signiﬁcantly different in
comparison to the existing counterpart food, feed or ingredient not produced using gene
technology;
(c) the food produced using modern biotechnology that contains a new factor known to cause an
allergic response in particular sections of the population;
(d) the intended use of the food produced using modern biotechnology if it is different from the
existing counterpart food produced using gene technology;
(e) the food derived from genetically modiﬁed organisms which contains any other
characteristics or properties that differ from the conventional counterpart not mentioned in
paragraph (a) to (d) above; or
(f)the genetic modiﬁcation raises signiﬁcant ethical, cultural and religious concerns regarding
the origin of the genetic material used in the genetic modiﬁcation.
8.Claims
(1) Genetically modiﬁed organisms shall not be described or labelled in a manner that is false,
misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding their character in
any respect.
(2) Any claim on a label that a product is genetic modiﬁcation free shall have a clear printed statement
indicating that the claim is true and not misleading, and shall be supported by validated testing and
documentation of the handling practices and procedures.
(3) Validated testing shall be carried out in appropriate accredited laboratories and analytical
procedures used shall be required to be consistent with national and internationally laid down
procedures and protocols.
3The Biosafety (Labelling) Regulations (Legal Notice 40 of 2012)  Kenya
9.Traceability
(1) An operator shall at all stages of placing on the market a product consisting of or containing
genetically modiﬁed organisms, including bulk quantities, ensure that the following information is
transmitted in writing to the subsequent operator—
(a) that it contains or consists of genetically modiﬁed organisms; and
(b) the unique identiﬁer assigned to those genetically modiﬁed organisms in accordance with
these Regulations.
(2) At all subsequent stages of the placing on the market of the products referred to in subregulation
(1), operators shall ensure that the information received in accordance with that subregulation is
transmitted in writing to all other operators receiving the products along the supply chain.
(3) In the case of products consisting of or containing mixtures of genetically modiﬁed organisms to be
used only and directly as food or feed or for processing, the information referred to in subregulation
(1)(b) may be replaced by a list of the unique identiﬁers for all those genetically modiﬁed organisms
that have been used to constitute the mixtures.
(4) Each operator shall maintain a register describing the systems and procedures for each transaction
to be kept for a minimum period of ﬁve years.
(5) The Authority shall establish a mechanism for development and assignment of unique identiﬁers
where such identiﬁers are useful in traceability of genetically modiﬁed organisms.
10. Monitoring inspection and compliance
(1) The Authority shall liaise with the relevant regulatory agency to monitor any genetically modiﬁed
organisms for compliance with the requirements of these Regulations.
(2) Where the Authority is satisﬁed that a product consisting of or containing genetically modiﬁed
organisms has not been labelled in accordance with Regulation 7, the inspector shall serve the
operator with a notice in writing—
(a) prohibiting the placing on the market of the product until it is correctly labelled;
(b) prohibiting the removal of the product from the premises described in the notice other than
to facilitate the correct labelling of the product;
(c) requiring that the product be labelled in accordance with these Regulations within such
period as the inspector may deem reasonable.
(3) A notice under subregulation (1) may contain such conditions as the inspector is satisﬁed are
reasonable and may be amended, suspended or revoked by a further notice in writing by the
inspector at any time.
(4) A notice under this Regulation shall be complied with at the cost of the operator on whom it is
served.
(5) If a notice under this Regulation, or an action required by the notice to be taken, is not complied
with within the period speciﬁed in the notice, an inspector may arrange for it to be complied with
and all reasonable costs of taking such action shall be recoverable by the Authority as a penalty due
from the operator on whom the notice was served.
(6) Where the product has been placed on the market prior to the date of the notice, the inspector
may require the withdrawal of the product within such period as he may reasonably believe to be
necessary.
