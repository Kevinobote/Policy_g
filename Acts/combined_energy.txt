its economic life.
5The Energy (Electricity Regulatory Accounts) Regulations, 2022 (Gazette Notice 10556 of 2023)  Kenya
(3) Where the dominant purpose or function of a ﬁxed asset is to support a single business activity
referred to in Regulation 5(2), or derives from such a business activity, that asset shall be allocated
to that activity.

another, such as a transformer, it shall be treated as supporting the upstream activity.

activity—

upstream activity that it relates to;

For the purpose of preparing a statement of ﬁnancial position, unless the licensee considers that the
ﬁnancial position of its separate businesses can be considered as distinct from its ﬁnancial position and
it would be misleading to a reader of the regulatory accounts not to do so, liabilities and non-ﬁxed assets
need not be allocated to the licensee’s separate businesses.
11. Cost Allocations
(1) Operating costs, including depreciation, shall be allocated to the separate businesses referred to in
Regulation 5(2) in relation to the way resources are consumed and with reference to the causation
of cost at the level of business activities (activity-based).

to a single activity, shall be allocated objectively using a reasonable methodology, having regard to
the materiality of the allocations, on:—
(a) a cost-allocation methodology that materially meets best practice standards of activity-based
allocation, or
(b) where an activity basis cannot be computed at a reasonable cost, an alternative basis that
provides a reasonable proxy for an activity-based allocation of costs in the light of best
available information about the causation of cost.
(3) The Authority may require licensees to develop activitybased cost allocation systems.
(4) Except where costs do not relate to services supported by regulated tariffs, such as costs of
corporate activities set out under Regulation 5(2)(g) , all other costs shall be fully allocated to the
other activities of the holder where they fall under Regulations 5(2)(a)  to (f), as appropriate.
(5) The allocation of depreciation of ﬁxed assets will reﬂect the usage of assets and will not necessarily
reﬂect the balance sheet allocation of ﬁxed assets under Regulation 10, as inter-activity recharges
of depreciation.

(1) Revenues shall be allocated as follows—
(a) In respect to tariff-controlled licensees, revenues from the following tariffs shall be allocated

recovery provision maintained in accordance with the Energy (Electricity Tariffs) Regulations, 2022,

an asset.

in enough detail for a user of regulatory accounts to understand components of the regulatory
