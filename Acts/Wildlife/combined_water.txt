AMU SAND DUNES AQUIFER GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION AREA MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
PREAMBLE
These management guidelines were prepared by the Water Resources Authority after extensive stakeholder
consultations for the proposed Amu Sand Dunes Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Area (GCA). The
stakeholders include; National Government departments (National Museums of Kenya(NMK), Ministry of
Interior and Coordination National Government, National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA),
Kenya Forest Services (KFS), Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS), County Government of Lamu, AMU Water Resource
Users Association (WRUA), Public, Amu Council of Elders and other institutions. The GCA is established in
accordance with Fourth Schedule of the Water Act (Cap. 372) and the Water Resources Management Rules, 2007
and subsequent legislations.
The Water Resources Management Rules, 2007 outline the process of identifying areas to be designated as
groundwater protection and conservation areas.
Section 23 of the Water Act (Cap. 372), provides that where the Authority is satisﬁed that in any area special
measures for the conservation of groundwater are necessary in the public interest, it may by order published in
the Gazette , declare the area to be a groundwater conservation area. The Authority is also mandated to impose
4The Amu Sand-dunes Groundwater Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 210 of 2021)  Kenya
such requirements or prohibit such conduct or activities in relation to a groundwater conservation area as it may
consider necessary for the conservation of the groundwater.
Accordingly, these Guidelines will come into operation upon publication in the Gazette  or such other time as the
publication shall prescribe.
Section 124 and Part D of the Sixth Schedule of the Water Resources Management Rules 2007, sets out the
contents of management rules or plans related to a protected area or groundwater conservation area and may
include:
1. Procedures to be applied for the management of the Protected Area or Groundwater Conservation Area;
2. Prohibited activities;
3. Any measures required to be undertaken for water resource conservation and protection;
4. The timeframe for implementation of required measures;
5. Any other conditions that the Authority may consider relevant This document presents the proposed
management procedures and prohibited activities in the Amu Sand Dunes Aquifer GCA.
Extent of the Amu GCA
The Amu GCA lies approximately 2 kilometres south of Lamu town and stretches from Kizingoni area at the
south western tip of the Island and terminates at Singue area that marks the south eastern edge of the Island
near the Shella Village.
The area covered by the proposed GCA is approximately is 19.72 square Kilometres (Map 1a & 1b below)

1. OBJECTIVE
Groundwater is and will continue to be a major source of water for the Amu Island, Lamu Archipelago as well as
the Lamu mainland. However, it has been established through Lamu Island sand dunes aquifer mapping study
that, more groundwater is being used than is being replenished through natural means. The study inferred that
sea water intrusion, over abstraction, loss of vegetal cover and encroachment has created a threat to groundwater
availability both in terms of quality and quantity.
To address this problem, the Water Act (Cap. 372) has provided a way for groundwater resources to be managed
and protected through establishment of Ground Water Conservation Areas (GCAs) as provided for in Section 23
of the Act.
The objective of the GCA guidelines is to provide a framework under which ground water catchment areas and
water resources use will be managed in a manner such that will ensure the groundwater resources is protected
and conserved sustainably.
The desired future condition is derived from the current status of Amu sand dunes aquifer. According to Lamu
Sand dunes water catchment Mapping Report (2008) and recent data from LAWASCO in 2017 the aquifer has been
7The Amu Sand-dunes Groundwater Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 210 of 2021)  Kenya
experiencing stress. It was found that several wells had turned saline and some had dried. This situation attests
to the fact that more groundwater is being extracted at a higher rate than it is replenished.
The desired future condition must provide a balance between the highest practicable level of groundwater
production and the conservation, preservation, protection, recharging and prevention of waste of groundwater in
the Conservation area.
Consequently, the desired future condition of the GCA is summed as follows:
1. Groundwater quality remains potable by Kenyan Standards (KEBS: KS 05-459: Part 1: 1996);
2. Annual renewable groundwater recharge is sustained at or over the year 2017 level;
3. Mitigation measures are put in place to cope with climate change effects;
4. Annual groundwater abstraction does not exceed 70% of the total aquifer recharge;
5. Fresh water levels are sustained to wade of sea water intrusion and possibly reverse current intrusion;
6. Conjunctive water use is considered to cope with pressure emanating from population rise and other emerging
developments;
7. Other groundwater dependent ecosystems, here identiﬁed as ﬂora and fauna , are protected;
To achieve these targets, guidelines on the following aspects of groundwater use, protection and conservation are
required:
1. Abstraction limits;
2. Water use prioritization and efﬁciency;
3. Borehole construction guidelines;
4. Groundwater recharge;
5. Groundwater monitoring;
6. Water allocation guidelines;
7. Conjunctive water use;
8. Pollution control;
9. Enforcement of AMU GCA guidelines and Water Act (Cap. 372);
10. Catchment and Groundwater conservation;
2.1. Abstraction Limits
2.1.1 Maximum allowable production To minimize as far as practicable the
1. Water levels decline does (not to go beyond 30% of the initial water column in the well),
2. Sea water intrusion into the freshwater zone ,
3. Deterioration of water quality within KEBS drinking water standard
4. potential loss of opportunity to construct a new well because of spacing requirements and over abstraction of
ground water and
5. Groundwater resources waste
The following guidelines shall apply in the GCA to regulate the production of groundwater.
1. Availability goal
8The Amu Sand-dunes Groundwater Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 210 of 2021)  Kenya
The Water Allocation Guidelines provide for 25% of the tested yield over a 24 hr period, or 60% of the tested yield
over a 10-hour period as the maximum allowable production as a general WRM rule. This shall continue to apply
in the GCA as it does in all groundwater systems.
2. Permitting goal
Right to access clean and safe water equitably is a constitutional requirement (COK 2010 article 43d)
administered through permitting ensuring reserve is not violated.
The goal is to ensure available water resources are allocated in a manner that reserve is addressed and water use
is prioritized for current and future domestic purposes.
To minimize wastage and to address the potential loss of opportunity to access groundwater, the permitting goal
will also endeavour to match the permitted amount with the applied use. Therefore permitted amounts will be
based on the per capita water requirements set out in the Design Manual as reproduced in the Water Allocation
Guidelines.
WRA shall therefore make reasonable effort not to grant permit applications for more water production than is
actually needed for beneﬁcial use as will be deﬁned within the Amu Sand dunes Water allocation Plan. The Water
Allocation Plan shall be developed and will deﬁne distances between wells/ boreholes and abstraction limits.
Further in Amu GCA no well shall be operated without obtaining necessary permits from Water Resources
Authority in consultation with AMU WRUA as set out in the WRM Rules 2007 and Water Act (Cap. 372).
Permitted use of groundwater will however be reviewed to ensure safe yield is sustainably maintained. Therefore,
changes in abstraction and use of groundwater under a current use operating permit may not be made without
prior approval of WRA.
3. Water use charges
Water use charges shall apply to all water abstractors as required by Water Act (Cap. 372).
In the case of Amu GCA, abstractors will be subject to speciﬁc conditions and penalties that apply to all
Groundwater Conservation Areas as speciﬁed in the WRM Rules 2007 section 108 and/or any other relevant
subsequent legislations.
Exclusions and exemptions
Current use
Existing legal groundwater use in the GCA before the effective date of the GCA management guidelines shall
be preserved, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with WRM Rules 2007 and/or any other relevant
subsequent Legislation. Evidence of current use must be presented to WRA before such use may be preserved.
Whenever preserved, such use will be regularized by WRA in line with the GCA guidelines.
2.2. Well/Borehole Siting in GCA
Siting of wells/boreholes in the GCA shall be subject to all provisions of the WRM Rules 2007 (section 27) and
Codes of Practice for Borehole Siting.
The siting shall be done by a licensed geologist/hydro-geologist. He/she shall compile a hydrogeological
assessment report in conformity with WRM Rules Second Schedule including water balance before and after the
proposed development.
Further to this, particular emphasis shall be laid to investigation methods which shall include an exhaustive
inventory of existing data, including all existing groundwater abstraction in the neighbourhood of the current
application without exception. Other Conditions for the Authority to grant an authorisation for drilling the
borehole, including limits to abstraction, mandatory borehole design considerations; etc shall be stated by the
siting geologist/hydrogeologist in his/her recommendations.
He/she shall demonstrate in the report that investigation has been exhaustively done for WRA to consider
granting the authorization to drill.
For Amu GCA
9The Amu Sand-dunes Groundwater Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 210 of 2021)  Kenya
1. An application for major development within the GCA shall be accompanied by an environmental impact study
that demonstrates that the quality and quantity of groundwater in the GCA and the recharge function of the area
will be protected, conserved, improved or restored.
2. Groundwater use applications that promote storm water management and inﬁltration will be given priority
in granting of authorisations to drill within the GCA. Such plans shall be subject to approval so that they do not
pose groundwater contamination risk.
2.3 Borehole Construction
These guidelines are subject to the Codes of Practice for Construction of Boreholes and should be applied in
conjunction with the following documents:
1. The Water Resources Management Rules, 2007 and subsequent legislations
2. The Code of Practice for the Siting of Boreholes
3. The Code of Practice for the Supervision of Construction of Boreholes
4. The Code of Practice for the Test Pumping of Boreholes
5. The Water Allocation Guidelines (2010)
2.3.1 Spacing requirements
To minimize as far as practicable the
a) Drawdown of the water table and the reduction of artesian pressure, to prevent interference between boreholes
and to
b) Prevent degradation of water quality the Water Resources Authority will enforce spacing requirements on all
new boreholes in the GCA. These will be in accordance with the spacing guidelines outlined in the (4).4 of the
Water Allocation Guidelines (2010).
c) In the case of a public supply well ﬁeld, WRA may waive the spacing requirements on the well ﬁeld if the
applicant submits adequate evidence showing that the increased cone of depression caused by the well ﬁeld will
not increase the impact on nearby existing wells.
This calls for, inter alia , appropriately designed pumping tests and well ﬁeld layout design.
2.3.2 Sanitary seal
The boreholes and wells in the GCA shall be lined to such a depth that will provide a reasonable seal to
contaminated or polluted surface water. The area is a high-recharge area that is unconﬁned thereby highly
susceptible to high risk of groundwater contamination
2.3.3 Defective/Unsuccessful wells/boreholes
Abandoning of defective/unsuccessful wells/boreholes shall be subject to sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Fourth
Schedule of the Water Act (Cap. 372) and in accordance with the Codes of Practice for Borehole Construction.
The defective well arising from salty water shall be plugged or sealed off securely by the owner of the well to
prevent intrusion into the fresh water aquifer thereby rendering the entire aquifer saline.
In addition to backﬁlling, an abandoned borehole in the GCA shall be sealed in the top 6 metres to ground level
with bentonite.
2.4. Pollution Control
These guidelines shall be applied in conjunction with Water Act (Cap. 372) and Part V of the WRM Rules 2007.
Due to the need to prevent pollution in the GCA, upon inspection, WRA may provide notice to affected parties
and issue orders to prevent pollution. If WRA determines that an emergency situation exists, a temporary order
to prohibit pollution and protect public health, safety and welfare shall be issued without notice. The order shall
continue in effect for the lesser of ﬁfteen (15) days or until tests are done. If the factual basis for the order is
10The Amu Sand-dunes Groundwater Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 210 of 2021)  Kenya
disputed, the affected parties may lodge a complaint with the Water Tribunal. The order shall however stay in
place until the Tribunal determines the appeal.
2.5 Groundwater Recharge, Monitoring and Conservation
The recharge mechanism within the sand dune catchment area is through direct precipitation where rain water
inﬁltrates/percolates within the highly permeable wind- blown sands to augment groundwater storage.
Beneﬁcial land and water management practices that maximize aquifer recharge with good water quality and
high quantity will be promoted. Gazettement of the GCA, rain water storage, biodiversity improvement and
prohibition of degrading activities such as sand harvesting, deforestation through harvesting of mukoma for
traditional liquor are among the proposed best practices.
Aquifer performance will be monitored to provide updated information. Therefore hydromet monitoring
networks comprised of telemetric boreholes, full weather stations and a data centre will be established.
3. EXEMPT AND PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES
3.1 Prohibited Activities The prohibited activities will be as per WRM Rules 2007
Sixth Schedule to the following activities that are considered high-impact uses due to the probability and/or
potential magnitude of their adverse effects on groundwater and shall be prohibited in the GCA:
1. Tillage or cultivation on the sand dunes;
2. Clearing of indigenous trees/vegetation on the sand dunes;
3. Building of permanent structures;
4. Disposal of any form of waste within the sand dune: large capacity septic, untreated waste disposal wells, open
defecation cemetery, untreated sewage waste disposal wells, cesspools, industrial waste , pit latrines;
5. Excavation of soil or development of quarries;
6. Planting of exotic species that may have adverse effect to water resources;
7. Landﬁlls;
8. Construction of permanent residential structures;
9. Sand harvesting;
10. Activities that would signiﬁcantly reduce the recharge to aquifers obstruction of dune formation;
11. Radioactive waste disposal sites;
12. Charcoal burning, grazing, harvesting of Mukoma tree for traditional brew;
13. Or any other activity that in the opinion of the Authority and other relevant stakeholders may degrade the
water resource.
3.3 Enforcement
The enforcement of management guidelines and prohibitions shall be in accordance with provisions of the Water
Act (Cap. 372), Water Resources Management Rules 2007 and other subsequent legislations.
These shall include, inter alia, PART VIII - Water Use Charges, entails and additional ﬁve per cent to the water
use charges. The itemized prohibited activities shall be enforced and complied with to all respective Authorities
and the public through the gazette notice. GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION MEASURES
4.1 Conservation activities
The following activities will be undertaken to roll out the conservation plan post- gazettement:-
1. Public awareness campaigns following Gazettement of the GCA.
11The Amu Sand-dunes Groundwater Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 210 of 2021)  Kenya
2. Reconciliation of the water permit database for the GCA with the actual abstraction points to ensure all
existing groundwater abstractions are authorized.
3. Reconciliation of water use with the permit database to capture the actual abstraction against the permitted
abstraction.
4. Review of permits to equitably match water needs with the permitted abstraction. A moratorium shall be
declared for those found to be over- abstracting and their permits regularized to reﬂect the actual abstraction
conditions, as long as the reviewed water use limit has been assessed positively and the permit revised
accordingly.
5. Review of the Second Schedule (Technical Reports) contents of Hydrogeological Assessment Report for
borehole siting in the GCA to include speciﬁc requirements for conservation areas. The revised rules will give
reporting guidance to include deﬁnitions of the recharge/discharge conditions, identify groundwater/surface
water interactions, characterize vulnerability to contamination, and provide a pre-to-post project water balance
analysis and recommendation of appropriate mitigation measures.
6. Coordination with the Lamu County Government physical planning, agriculture, water, sanitation departments
and NEMA to highlight GCA management guidelines and technical advice on County by-laws where required.
7. Installation of dedicated monitoring wells for the various aquifer levels in the GCA.
8. Enforcement of WRM Rules and GCA management guidelines.
9. Implementation of WRUA SCMP incorporating ecotourism activities The Management Plan for the Amu GCA
will comprise of the Water use plan, aquifer protection plan, conservation and recharge enhancement plan,
aquifer protection plan education plan and ecotourism plan. The management plan will be reviewed every so
often as to match the conservation needs and issues.

1.Introduction and Background Information
1.1 Introduction
A catchment area is deﬁned as the land from which water naturally ﬂows into a water course. The status
and conditions of a catchment determines the reliability, quantity and quality of its water yields. A
catchment area acts like a water storage facility where during the rains, the vegetation cover allows the
water ample time to percolate deep down and move as a sub-surface ﬂow to recharge the rivers, springs
and ground water storage in both shallow and deep aquifers. This sub-surface ﬂow is slow resulting in
rivers from a well maintained catchment having higher base ﬂows even during the dry season as well as
good water yield from boreholes in the vicinity. In poorly maintained and degraded catchment, the rainfall
results in the rapid surface run-off which is channelled into the river courses, resulting in ﬂash-ﬂoods and
high volumes of suspended solids. Since there is little storage in such a catchment, the rivers originating
from such catchment will not be able to sustain their base ﬂows during the dry season.
Catchment areas are thus a vital component in water resource management and they should be formally
delineated, gazetted, protected from encroachment and pollution and managed sustainably to maintain
their ecological integrity.
1.1.1 Legal Framework for Catchment Protection:
Because of its nature, environmental management and protection in general and catchment protection
and management in particular falls within the mandate of many institutions. Catchment protection
is therefore, a cross-cutting issue which is spread over several laws, which have a bearing on the
environment and/or natural resources management. These legislations include:
i) Constitution of Kenya
Article 66 deals with land and provides that the State may regulate the use of any land, or any interest in
or right over any land, in the public interest.
Article 69 deals with the environment and natural resources including the sustainable exploitation,
utilisation, management and conservation and the equitable sharing of the accruing beneﬁts. It is also
the duty of every person to cooperate with State organs and other persons to protect and conserve the
environment and ensure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources.
5The Dik Dik Gardens Wetland Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 206 of 2021)  Kenya
Article 70 deals with the enforcement of environmental rights by any person.
ii). Water Act (Cap. 372)
Section 22 provides that where the Authority is satisﬁed that special measures are necessary to protect
catchment area or part thereof, it may, with the approval of the Cabinet Secretary, by order published in
the Gazette  declare such an area to be a protected area.
The Authority may impose such requirements, and regulate or prohibit such conduct or activities, in or in
relation to a protected area that the Authority may think necessary to impose, regulate or prohibit for the
protection of the area and its water resources.
Under Sections 23 of the Act, the Authority may identify a catchment area, part of a catchment area or
water resource to be identiﬁed as areas to be Protected or designated as Groundwater Conservation Areas
if the Authority is satisﬁed that doing so is necessary for the protection of the water resource and its
multiple uses. The Authority shall, in conjunction with relevant institutions and stakeholders, establish
management rules or plans that shall apply to each Protected Area or Groundwater Conservation Area.
iii). Water Resources Management Rules 2007
Part IX - section 116 - 120 provides for the determination of the riparian land, which as deﬁned in Part I of
these rules does not imply a change of ownership but imposes management controls on land use for water
resource quality as deﬁned in these rules.
This part deals extensively with the management of the riparian land including its management, activities
that are allowed or proscribed within the riparian land.
The Authority shall undertake Public Consultation with respect to the establishment of areas to be
Protected or designated as Groundwater Conservation Areas and the management rules or plans that shall
apply with respect to these Areas.
iv). The Agriculture (Basic Land Usage) Rules No 6 of—
Part – of the rules provide for the protection of water course. Any person who, except with written
permission of an authorised ofﬁcer, cultivates or destroy the soil, or cuts down any vegetation or
depastures any livestock, on any land laying within 2 metres of a water course, or, in any case of a water
course more than 2 meters wide, within a distance equal to the width of that watercourse to a maximum of
30 metres, shall be guilty of an offence.
v). The Forest Act 2005
Section 26 states that upon the recommendation of the board, the Cabinet Secretary may, by order
published in gazette, declare any local authority forest or private forest, which in the opinion of the board
is mismanaged or neglected, to be a provisional forest.
The declaration envisaged under this section shall only be made where the forest is:
• An important catchment area or a source of water springs;
• Is rich in biodiversity or contains rare, threatened or endangered species;
• Is of cultural or scientiﬁc signiﬁcance; or
• Supports an important industry or is a source of livelihood for the surrounding communities; and
• The owner has failed to undertake speciﬁc sivilcultural practices to improve the forest, or is unable to
undertake the speciﬁed practice as directed by the Director of Kenya Forest Service.
vi). Survey Act (Survey Regulations)
Part XII sections 110 – 114 deals with the survey of Government Land. Speciﬁcally, section 111 deals with
the aspect of riparian land as it relates to the rivers.
6The Dik Dik Gardens Wetland Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 206 of 2021)  Kenya
On all tidal rivers a reservation of not less than 30 metres in width above high-water mark shall be made
for Government purposes. However, the Cabinet Secretary may direct that the width of this reservation
shall be less than 30 metres in special cases.
vii). Relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The sustainable Development Goals have the following targets, among others—
Target 6b - Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and
sanitation management
Target 6.3 - By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing
release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and
substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally
Target 6.6: By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands,
rivers, aquifers and lakes
1.1.2 Background information on Dik Dik Gardens Wetland:
The Dik Dik Catchment (herein after referred to as the "wetland") is located within Kileleshwa sub
location of Kilimani location within Nairobi City County. The land under consideration measures
approximately 7 acres (2.8 hectares), and had been sub divided into 17 plots and issued with Land
Reference Numbers: 209/11609/1, 209/11609/2, 209/11609/3, 209/11609/4, 209/11609/5, 209/11609/6,
209/11609/7, 209/11609/8, 209/11609/9, 209/11609/10, 209/11609/11, 209/11609/, 209/11609/,
209/11609/13, 209/11609/14. The wetland is not spread over all the plots and its boundaries will be
surveyed and demarcated.
The area lies within the 3BA sub basin and is part of the Nairobi river sub drainage. The land under
question is in the form of a basin-like depression with an outlet to the south-east into Kirichwa Ndogo
River. The major parts of three plots have wetland-like features with a very shallow water table and
evidence of water coming onto the surface and ﬂowing in a south-easterly direction to drain into the
Kirichwa Ndogo River approximately 500 meters downstream of the wetland. An analysis of the drainage
system in the neighbourhood conﬁrmed the area is one of the main sources of Kirichwa Ndogo River, a
tributary of Nairobi River.
1.1.3 Rationale for Catchment Protection through Gazettement;
Dik Dik Gardens wetland constitutes one of the main sources of water for Kirichwa Ndogo River. The
wetland is threatened with destruction after it was surveyed and demarcated into plots whose owners
hold Title Deeds for it and intend to develop structures on them. Initially, the area had been set aside
for public use as a water catchment but was later alienated as private land. The Dik Dik Gardens
community has consistently complained about ongoing destruction resulting in diminishing water ﬂows
and environmental degradation. The complaints have been addressed by WRA, Judiciary, Ministry of
Tourism and Wildlife, and other stakeholders within the catchment without success mainly because
the land owners has title deeds. To ensure proper conservation and protection of the wetland, WRA,
community and other key stake-holders recognised the need for Gazettement of the land. In this regard,
a stakeholders’ meeting was convened on 02/02/2021 to build consensus on the way forward. The Dik Dik
Gardens community has expressed their willingness and intentions to have the wetland protected and
conserved a top priority in order to assure the riparian community and other stakeholders of adequate and
sustainable water resource availability.
ABA’s CMS (2014 - 2022) has recognised the need to protect the wetlands and increase their
environmental functions. This will be achieved through the implementation of the following strategies:
• Sensitization of the local community on the need to protect the wetland to ensure environmental
sustainability;
• Development of an action plan to protect the catchment and their rehabilitation;
• Participatory mapping of the protection zones around the wetlands with the community;
7The Dik Dik Gardens Wetland Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 206 of 2021)  Kenya
• Apply the law to protect wetland (enforcement for wetlands/riparian/springs protection);
In addition, Part XI of WRM Rules section 123 - 125 sets out the process and procedure for the
identiﬁcation of an area as a protected or groundwater conservation area. This is the procedure used in
coming up with this Gazettement document for the Dik Dik Gardens wetland.
1.2. Location and size of area to be gazetted
The area identiﬁed for Gazettement is commonly known as Dik Dik Gardens wetland. It is located in
Kileleshwa sub location of Kilimani location, Westlands Sub County, Nairobi City County and within the
3BA sub basin of Athi Basin Area. The land area to be protected is approximately 7 acres (2.8 Hectares).
The boundaries of the wetland will be demarcated and beacons placed in line with the pegging carried out
by Water Resources Authority.
1.2.1 Watershed area;
The area that contributes surface run-off into the wetlands has been delineated through the use of
ArcSWAT software. The area measures 0.028 square kilometres (2.8 hectares) out of the 5.3 km2 catchment
area of the Kirichwa Ndogo River as shown in Fig 1 below:
Physiography, climate and rainfall;
a) Physiography
The Kirichwa Ndogo river catchment area elevation ranges from a low of 1714 m.a.s.l near the river’s
conﬂuence with Kirichwa Kubwa River to a high of 1807 m.a.s.l to the south west of the catchment. The
8The Dik Dik Gardens Wetland Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 206 of 2021)  Kenya
catchment is leaf shaped and extends upstream in north easterly direction with a length of 4.7 kilometres
(see the map above).
The slope ranges between 1.2% to 8% with the steeper slopes found on the upstream part of the
catchment. The catchment drains in a north-easterly direction, where it joins with the Kirichwa Kubwa
River at the foot of the sub-catchment.
b) Climate
The mean monthly temperatures range between a low of 16.7°C in July to a high of 20.7°C in March.
The Kirichwa Ndogo sub catchment lies within the agro ecological zones (AEZ) IV UM. In general the
area is characterized by moderate rainfall with annual rainfall of 1002.3 mm (Strathmore College Rainfall
Station No. 9136199). April to June and October to December are wet or rainy seasons with maximas
occurring in April and November respectively and with continental rains which are low occurring in
between the two maximas. The table and ﬁgure below represent the mean monthly rainfall at Strathmore
College Rainfall station:

c) Vegetation:
The Kirichwa Ndogo catchment in which the Dik Dik Gardens wetland catchment lies exhibits is within a
settled area with changed vegetation.
d) Current land use and its adverse impacts,
The Kirichwa Ndogo sub catchment is within the jurisdiction of Nairobi City County in an urban setting.
The main land use in the area is low density residential housing area but with upcoming high density
commercial cum residential buildings. The construction of buildings and an increase in the impermeable
surfaces has resulted in an increased surface run-off which ends up in the wetlands as well as into the
rivers channels. The run-off carries pollutants from the surface as well as sediments which are deposited
in the wetland thus affecting its functions as well as water quality.
Mushrooming of these structures will impact negatively on the ecosystem health of the wetland which will
eventually result into its death and subsequent loss of ecosystem services.

2.Current Situation Analysis
2.1 The vulnerability of the water resource
Kirichwa Ndogo River has a Regular Gauging Station 3BA41 located at coordinates E036.800000,
S01.272778 (37M 0255194.5, 9859215) at an elevation of 1705 m.a.s.l and approximately 2.4 km
downstream of the Dik Dik Gardens wetland but the station has no available daily water levels or
discharge data.
In terms of geology, the area is covered by the Kerichwa Valley Tuffs which are well exposed in
the Kirichwa Ndogo stream that ﬂows through the area (Gregory, 1921p 164) and were designated
by Shackleton (1945) to include a group of trachytic tuffs and agglomerates in the Nairobi area
younger than the Nairobi Trachyte. These tuffs overlie the Nairobi Trachyte.
The ground water system feeds into the surface drainage system of the Kirichwa Ndogo River
through the numerous springs that exist in the area.
The encroachment on the Dik Dik Gardens wetland riparian and catchment land through
construction of buildings and the planting of exotic tree species has resulted into reduced recharge
into the ground, lowering of the water table and a decrease in the discharge of the Kirichwa Ndogo
River.
In order to have a clear understanding of the water resources availability in the Kirichwa Ndogo
catchment, the available data has been used and collated with the existing daily discharge data of
rated gauging stations within the 3BA sub basin. Kirichwa Ndogo river has a sub catchment area of
5.3 km2 compared to the catchment area of the RGS 3BA29 of 56.5 km2. The RGS 3BA29 has daily
discharge data from 1961 and this has been used to estimate the probable surface water availability
for the Kirichwa Ndogo river.
According to the correlation between Kirichwa Ndogo and Nairobi river sub- catchments, the
following scenario on surface water availability emerges:

2.2 The water resource quality objectives and the current status of the water resource
According to the ABA CMS (2014 - 2022) Kirichwa Ndogo sub-catchment can be classiﬁed as of
high Commercial importance. The area has predominantly urban and/or industrial agglomeration
areas including their peripheral areas, which could be commercial. This category targets at ensuring
quality of water resources to develop economy and prosperity in urban areas/industrial centres.
Sustainable water resources management in the sub catchment will focus on cooperation with
the commercial stakeholders, hence the need to have the interests of residents, industrialists and
business community safeguarded.
2.3 The class of the water resource
11The Dik Dik Gardens Wetland Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 206 of 2021)  Kenya
The Kirichwa Ndogo sub-catchment can be classiﬁed as "Alert" as the available water is at times not
of adequate quality to meet the demand. The water is of relatively good quality in the upper parts of
the river but deteriorates as the river ﬂows downstream due to pollution.
2.4 Land uses and their potential impact on the water resources
2.4.1 Human settlement
Kirichwa Ndogo river sub catchment is located within an area with predominantly formal
low to medium density human settlement. Due to the development pressure, more high-
riseq1 buildings are coming up, replacing the existing single family units. This will put more
pressure on the existing infrastructures and utilities, including water and sewerage services.
This will have a major adverse impact on the water quality as it has been observed that where
the sewerage infrastructure is not developed in pace with other developments, sewer leaks
and bursts have resulted from the overwhelmed lines, polluting the water resources.
The development of more buildings will also result in an increase in the paved surfaces
which are impermeable. This will generate more surface run-off resulting in water pollution
and ﬂooding as the existing storm water facilities may be inadequate to evacuate the
resultant run-off.
2.4.2 Exotic Species of Plants
There exist numerous exotic species of trees which are unsuitable in a water catchment area,
especially near wetland, which include the eucalyptus trees.
3.Measures for Conservation and Rehabilitation of the area
3.1 Proscribed Activities;
According to the relevant legal framework as discussed in Sub-Section 1.1.1 above, protected
areas can be used by the neighbouring community in a sustainable manner. The activities to be
undertaken within the protected area are those with zero impact on its ecological status and
integrity. The following activities are speciﬁcally proscribed in a protected area:
i). Tillage or cultivation
ii). Clearing of indigenous trees or vegetation
iii). Building of permanent structures (especially boreholes and houses)
iv). Disposal of any form of waste
v). Excavation of soil or development of quarries
vi). Planting of exotic species that may have adverse effect to the water resource
3.2 Conservation Plan
The objective of the conservation plan is to protect the long term environmental sustainability of
the catchment for enhanced water resources yield and maintain its ecological functions in terms of
ﬂora and fauna. This will be achieved through:
• Demarcate the wetland and its riparian zone and fence it off;
• Gazette  the Dik Dik Gardens Wetland as a protected water catchment area;
• Enforce the Dik Dik Gardens wetland guidelines;

1.3 Application of the Plan
This Plan shall apply in respect to the management and use of the Karai Wetland Conservation Area.
1.4. Objectives
The objectives of this Plan are to—
(i) enhance implementation of existing regulations to protect the rights of all users;
(ii) promote water, use efﬁciency that is hydrologically and economically beneﬁcial to domestic,
agricultural, and industrial water users and the environment; and
(iii) identify funding sources to implement water conservation programs that help to enhance water
resources;
1.5 Introduction and Background information
A catchment area is deﬁned as the land from which water naturally ﬂows into a water course. The status
and conditions of a catchment determines the reliability, quantity and quality of its water yields. A
catchment area acts like a water storage facility where during the rains, the vegetation cover allows the
water ample time to percolate deep down and move as a sub-surface ﬂow to recharge the rivers, springs
and ground water storage in both shallow and deep aquifers. This sub-surface ﬂow is slow resulting in
rivers from a well-maintained catchment having higher base ﬂows even during the dry season as well as
good water yield from boreholes in the vicinity. In poorly maintained and degraded catchment, the rainfall
results in the rapid surface run-off which is channeled into the river courses, resulting in ﬂashﬂoods and
high volumes of suspended solids. Since there is little storage in such a catchment, the rivers originating
from such catchment will not be able to sustain their base ﬂows during the dry season.
1.6 Wetlands are an important component of water balance within catchment areas in that they give rise to
different hydrological functions. Wetlands located in ﬂood plains play an effective role in ﬂood mitigation
as well as water storage. On the other hand, wetlands located at the foot of slopes or adjacent to rivers
tend to contribute to ﬂood peaks. Wetlands are also valuable for water quality improvement and shoreline
erosion control as well as provision of habitat for different species of aquatic and terrestrial plants and
animals. They also provide natural products, recreation, and aesthetics.
1.7 Catchment areas are thus a vital component in water resource management, and they should be formally
delineated, declared as protected areas by being gazetted as such, protected from encroachment and
pollution and managed sustainably to maintain their ecological integrity.
1.8 Location and size of the Protected Area
The Karai Wetland Conservation area (hereafter referred to as the "wetland" is spread within Karai Sub-
location of Kikuyu Sub- county, Kiambu County. It is located about 35 km to the west of Kiambu town. The
wetland covers an area of approximately 2.4 km2 and is within the 3BA Sub-basin of Athi Basin Area.
1.9 Karai wetland is a signiﬁcant ground water recharge area which falls within the upper Athi River Basin
area in Sub-basin 3BA. It is located west of Kikuyu Town in Kiambu County, Kikuyu Sub-county, Karai
Location.
1.10. Watershed area
The wetland receives water from the surrounding higher grounds, and does not have visible outlet.
Therefore, apart from the water that is lost through evaporation the rest is assumed to go into recharging
5The Karai Wetland Conservation Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 117 of 2023)  Kenya
ground water aquifers. The area measures 2.4 km2 out of the 858 km2 catchment area of the whole 3BA sub
basin in Athi Basin.
1.11 Criteria adopted in identifying Karai Wetland for protection
WRA has taken into account of the considerations provided under the Seventh Schedule of the Water
Resources Regulations, 2021.
Part II – PROCEDURES TO BE APPLIED FOR THE MANAGEMENT
OF THE KARAI WETLAND CONSERVATION AREA
2.1. Physiography
Karai wetland is located within the western part of Kiambu County at an elevation of about 2015masl. The
area is enclosed within gentle slopes of less than 10%.
2.2 Climate
The climate around Karai wetland is tropical with varying amount of rainfall during the year. The
Maximum temperatures are between 23° and 28°C and the minimum temperatures are between 13° and
l8°C. Mean monthly temperatures over 3BA sub basin are presented in Figure 3 below. From the analysis,
the months hottest months coincide with the long rain season, March to May (MAM) and October to
December (OND) short rain season while the coldest months are June to August.
Annexure 2 of the Second Schedule shows the monthly average temperatures within Karai Wetland.
2.3 Rainfall
Most parts of Karai area are hot and dry except for some parts of Gikambura and Renguti which are fairly
wet and cooler. Rainfall varies between 200mm and 850mm per year, decreasing gradually from the
eastern side towards the west, long rains are between March and May while the short rains are between
November and December. The driest months coincide with the coldest periods (July to August) and the
hottest months are January and February Annexure 3 of the Second Schedule shows the mean monthly
rainfall and humidity at Karai Wetland.
2.4 Vegetation
The same area is currently characterized by clearing of indigenous vegetation and the planting of exotic
tree species which has resulted into reduced recharge into the ground, lowering of the water table and a
decrease in the wetland hydrological water balance.
2.5 Vulnerability of the water resource
Karai wetland falls under sub basin 3BA in upper Athi basin area and it is drained by several streams as
shown in Figure 1 above.
There is no major river around the wetland, but several emanate downstream of the wetland. Therefore,
the surface water monitoring network cannot be used to determine the hydrology of the wetland.
2.6 The encroachment and human activities within the wetland riparian through cultivation, clearing of
indigenous vegetation and the planting of exotic tree species has resulted into reduced recharge into the
ground, lowering of the water table and a decrease in the wetland hydrological water balance.
2.7 Karai Wetland falls within the headwaters of sub basin 3BA which is the source of many rivers in
upper Athi basin. The wetland is not protected and has attracted a lot of human activities that include
cultivation, introduction of exotic species as well as human settlement over the years. This unsustainable
approach to the wetland use is threatening its survival and potential as a ground water recharge area.
2.8 The water resource quality objectives and the current status of the water resource
Section 20 of the Act requires the Authority to prescribe the criteria for classifying water resources for the
purposes of determining water resources quality objectives for each class of water resource.
6The Karai Wetland Conservation Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 117 of 2023)  Kenya
The Resource Quality Objectives represent the desired status of the resource, covering all aspects of
quantity, quality, timing and aquatic biota. The RQO’s are different for different classes of water resource.
The objectives generally relate to the extent to which the water body is allowed to be adversely impacted
by water use with respect to its natural state. Conceptually the RQO’s provide a "target" condition of the
resources.
Management decisions should be made such that the condition of the resource is progressively trending
towards the RQO. The status of the resource is a measure of how far the condition of the resource is from
the RQO. RQOs shall be determined at the nodes where the Reserve ﬂows are being determined.
2.9 The focus for water resources management is the protection of the natural ecological characteristics for
ecological, recreational and development of tourism with economic importance. Key water resources
issues include:
(a) Water scarcity.
(b) Catchment degradation.
(c) Erosion.
(d) Encroachment of water bodies and land tenure around the swamp.
(e) Human activities affect the wetland.
(f)Social conﬂicts due to over abstraction.
2.10 Sustainable regional water resources management of these units would require co-operation collaboration
and synergy with the Kenya Forest Service, WRUA, the Kenya Wildlife Service, Counties, user communities
and other stakeholders.
2.11 The class of the water resource
The present aquifer classiﬁcation system in Kenya is partly demand-oriented and partly geo-political and
entails ﬁve classes:
2.11.1 STRATEGIC aquifers: Aquifers used to supply signiﬁcant amounts/proportions of water to an area
where there are no alternatives, or where alternatives would take time and money to develop.
2.11.2 MAJOR aquifers: High-yielding aquifers with good quality water.
2.11.3 MINOR aquifers: Moderate-yielding aquifers with variable water quality.
2.11.4 POOR aquifers: Low-yielding aquifers with poor to reasonable quality water.
2.11.5 SPECIAL aquifers: Aquifers or parts of aquifers designated special aquifers' by the WRA.
2.12 Each is further deﬁned in terms of its status, i.e.
2.12.1 Satisfactory: no immediate stress, pressure or threat.
2.12.2 Alert: Stress, Pressure or threat identiﬁed or anticipated.
2.12.3 Alarm: Water levels declining, water quality declining (stress, pressure or threat identiﬁed).
2.13 The area can be classiﬁed as "Alert" as the available water is at times not of adequate quantity and quality
to meet the demand.
The water availability is relatively good in terms of quantity and quality in the upper parts of the river but
deteriorates as the river ﬂows downstream due to pollution.
2.14 Land uses and their potential impact on the water resources
The area around Karai wetland is predominantly rural settlement with the main land use being cultivation
and rearing of livestock.
7The Karai Wetland Conservation Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 117 of 2023)  Kenya
2.15 The potential impacts on the water resources as a result of human acts includes—
(a) Encroachment: People have encroached water catchment areas within the wetland.
(b) Overexploitation of available resources: The population in the area has been rapidly growing over
the years. This leads to excessive pressure on available natural resources that includes the wetland
leading to potential water use conﬂicts.
(c) Soil Erosion: Following uncontrolled farming and other human activities around the wetland, soil
erosion leads to loss of top soil cover.
(d) Deforestation: The wetland vegetation, the immediate catchment areas as well as the wider
catchment has been depleted due human activities. Forests have been cleared to give way for
farmlands, settlements as well as charcoal burning and timber; and
(e) Water Pollution: Due to excessive economic activities around the wetland and within the sub-basin
lake, the water has been polluted. The farms in the surrounding area use agro-chemicals which
eventually ﬁnd their way into the water bodies and leading to pollution. Other pollutants include
solid waste that is washed into the rivers by runoff water during rains.
Part III – MEASURES FOR PROTECTION, CONSERVATION AND
REHABILITATION OF THE KARAI WETLAND CONSERVATION AREA
3.1. Proscribed Activities
The activities to be undertaken within the protected area are those with zero impact on its ecological
status and integrity.
The following activities are hereby speciﬁcally prohibited in the protected area—
(viii) tillage or cultivation;
(ix) clearing of indigenous trees or vegetation;
(x) building of permanent structures (especially boreholes and houses);
(xi) disposal of any form of waste;
(xii) excavation of soil or development of quarries;
(xiii) planting of exotic species that may have adverse effect to the water resource; and
(xiv) land reclamation.
3.2. Catchment Protection Plan
The objective of the protection plan is to protect Karai Wetland by encouraging activities that enhance
both water quality and quantity while discouraging activities that cause the catchment degradation and
promoting beneﬁcial land and water management practices. This will be achieved through—
(a) sensitization on catchment management;
(b) revegetation of the catchment area by indigenous and water friendly plant propagation and exotic
species control;
(c) water storage enhancement to ease pressure on use of the wetland such as Rain water harvesting
tanks;
(d) regulating activities that may lead to pollution and destruction of the eco-system (Charcoal
burning, grazing, cultivation);
(e) controlling abstraction limits and observing of safe yields; and
8The Karai Wetland Conservation Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 117 of 2023)  Kenya
(f)controlling encroachment and cancellation of illegal titles.
This plan is discussed in further detail under Annexure 5 of the Second Schedule.
3.3 Conservation Plan
The objective of the conservation plan is to protect the long-term environmental sustainability of the
catchment for enhanced water resources yield and maintain its ecological functions in terms of ﬂora and
fauna. This will be achieved through—
(a) enhancing implementation of existing regulations to protect the rights of all the wetland users; and
(b) identify funding sources to implement water conservation programs that help to enhance wetland
water resources.
The Conservation Plan is contained under Annexure 4 of the Second Schedule.
3.4 Catchment Protection Plan
The objective of the catchment monitoring plan is to collect water resources data and maintain a
comprehensive database on the Karai wetland and its catchment that provides information on water levels
and quality of the wetland by carrying out the following—
(a) establishing a water quality and pollution control plan;
(b) water sampling and analysis; and
(c) establish a water resources database.
The Catchment Monitoring Plan is contained under Annexure 6 of the Second Schedule.
3.5. Establishment and operationalization of management structure
The objective of the management structure is to ensure that the Karai Wetland Conservation Area is
managed in a sustainable manner with the involvement of all stakeholders under the leadership and
coordination of WRA - ABA This plan envisages a budget of Kes 5,000,000 to implement it in the medium
term (approximately 5 years). The management will need to raise the funds through various activities and
events. This will be achieved through—
(a) setting up the management structure with deﬁned ToRs and mandates; and
(b) development and implementation of resource mobilization strategies to raise funds for the
management and conservation of the protected area.
Operationalization of the management structure shall be as set out under Annexure 7 of the Second
Schedule.

PREAMBLE
The Water Resources Management Authority (WRMA) was established under the Water Act, 2002
(Repealed) as a State Corporation under the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. WRMA has been in existence
since 2005 following its establishment. In order to harmonize functions and mandates as contemplated
under the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, the Water Act (Cap. 372), was established and operationalized.
Water Resources Authority (WRA) is established under Section 11 of the Water Act (Cap. 372). Pursuant
to Section 6 of the Act, the Authority is an agent of the National Government responsible for regulating
the management and use of water resources. WRA was operationalized on 21st of April, 2017 vide Gazette
Notice No. 59.
These management guidelines were prepared by the Water Resources Authority after extensive
stakeholder consultations from the Groundwater Conservation Area (GCA), including water users, area
Members of Parliament, Members of County Assembly and other institutions. The GCA is established in
accordance with the Water Act (Cap. 372) Section 23(2) and the Water Resources Management Rules, 2007
(with amendments in 2012).
The Water Resources Management Rules, 2007 outline the process of identifying areas to be designated as
groundwater protection and conservation areas. Part XI Rule 123(1) states that:
Pursuant to Sections 23(1) and (2) of the Water Act (Cap. 372), where the Authority is satisﬁed that in
any area special measures for the conservation of groundwater are necessary in the public interest it may
declare the area to be a groundwater conservation area. The Authority may also impose such requirements
or prohibit such conduct or activities in relation to a groundwater conservation area as it may consider
necessary for the conservation of the groundwater.
Part D of the Sixth Schedule of the Water Resources Management Rules 2007 sets out the contents of
management rules or plans related to a protected area or groundwater conservation area and may include:
(a) Procedures to be applied for the management of the Protected Area or Groundwater Conservation
Area;
(b) Prohibited activities;
(c) Any measures required to be undertaken for water resource conservation and protection;
(d) The timeframe for implementation of required measures;
(e) Any other conditions that the Authority may consider relevant
This document presents the management procedures and prohibited activities in the Kikuyu Springs
Aquifer GCA.
Extent of the Groundwater Conservation Area
For ease of identiﬁcation of boundaries, the southern edge of the GCA is to run west from the railway
tunnel south of Limuru along the road D407 and then join road A104 near Kamandura Primary School,
5The Kikuyu Springs Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Area Management Order (Legal Notice 208 of
2021)  Kenya
leave road A104 to join D409 (Ngenia Road) then cross to E430 before Kamirithu. It then leaves E430 and
6The Kikuyu Springs Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Area Management Order (Legal Notice 208 of
2021)  Kenya
turns north along the top of the escarpment east of Ngarariga Primary School. At Kirenga the boundary
turns east along the road heading to Bathi River.
The boundary then turns southwards along the watershed to Githirioni where it runs on the escarpment
along the railway line past Uplands all the way down through Limuru and joins back on Road D407 at the
end of the railway tunnel (Map 1).
Map 1. Groundwater Conservation Area (GCA) for the Kikuyu Springs Aquifer
OBJECTIVE
The objective of the GCA guidelines is to provide a framework under which groundwater use within the
conservation area will be undertaken in a manner such that the desired future condition of the resource is
fulﬁlled.
The desired future condition is derived from the current status. According to the Kikuyu Springs Aquifer
Study Report, as of 2012 up to 68% of the annual catchment recharge was abstracted annually. This is7The Kikuyu Springs Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Area Management Order (Legal Notice 208 of
2021)  Kenya
more than the 25% tested yield from each borehole into the aquifer in the Water Allocation Guidelines
published by WRA for safe yield and way over the 10% of mean annual recharge sustainable groundwater
yield adopted for the National Water Master Plan 2030. Fortunately, subsurface inﬂow from outside the
catchment provides an estimated 4.1 - 5.6 MCM, which, if added to the annual recharge reduces the
proportion of abstraction to between 48 and 52% of the total aquifer recharge.
These data make it clear that the aquifer is on the verge of overexploitation and certainly under pressure.
This rate of abstraction and its increase is not sustainable in the long run. The effect of the increasing
abstraction is seen in the deteriorating water quality as exempliﬁed by time series data that show
increasing mineralization of groundwater with time, on a linear trend. It is indicated that this state of
affairs is not unique to the Kikuyu Springs aquifer: the Nairobi Aquifer Suite as a whole is under threat of
overabstraction.
The desired future condition must provide a balance between the highest practicable level of groundwater
production and the conservation, preservation, protection, recharging, and prevention of waste of
groundwater in the Conservation area.
Consequently, the desired future condition of the GCA is summed as follows:
• Groundwater quality remains potable by Kenyan Standards (KEBS: KS 05-459: Part 1: 1996);
• Annual renewable groundwater recharge is sustained at or over the year 2012 level, subject to climate
change effects;
• Annual groundwater abstraction does not exceed 70% of the total aquifer recharge.
• Artesian pressure is maintained at a level that can sustain Ondiri Swamp and Kikuyu Springs.
• Other groundwater dependent ecosystems, here identiﬁed as wetlands, are protected.
To achieve these targets, guidelines on the following aspects of groundwater use and conservation are
required:
a). Abstraction limits;
b). Water use prioritization; c). Borehole construction; d). Groundwater recharge;
e). Groundwater monitoring;
f). Water allocation;
g). Pollution control;
h). Enforcement.
1.MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
2.1 Abstraction Limits
2.1.1 Maximum allowable production
To minimize as far as practicable the drawdown of the water table and the reduction of artesian
pressure, to prevent interference between boreholes, to prevent degradation of water quality, to
address the potential loss of opportunity to drill a new borehole because of spacing requirements,
and to prevent waste the following guidelines shall apply in the GCA to regulate the production of
groundwater.
(a) Availability goal
The Water Allocation Guidelines provide for 25% of the tested yield over a 24 hr period, or 60% of
the tested yield over a 10-hour period as the maximum allowable production as a general WRM rule.
This shall continue to apply in the GCA as it does in all groundwater systems.
(b) Permitting goal
8The Kikuyu Springs Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Area Management Order (Legal Notice 208 of
2021)  Kenya
To minimize wastage and diversion of water to other uses, and to address the potential loss of
opportunity to access groundwater, the permitting goal is to match the permitted amount with the
applied use. Therefore permitted amounts will be based on the per capita water requirements set
out in the Design Manual as reproduced in the Water Allocation Guidelines.
Based on these standards, the maximum permitted amount for domestic use for example is 1.5 m3/
day for a household of 6. In the typical situation, domestic permits are up to 10 m3/ day which is
not utilized in full or is diverted to other uses, thereby denying other users access to their water
rights. WRA shall therefore make reasonable effort to not grant permit applications for more water
production than is actually needed for beneﬁcial use.
(c) Reconciliation of water use
Water use charges that apply will be reconciled with the production against the permitted limit.
Where actual water use consistently falls to 40% or less of permitted amount for one year, WRA is at
liberty to review the permitted amount downwards.
Where the abstraction is consistently at least 105% or more of the permitted amount for one year
the water user will, along with infringement penalties speciﬁed in the WRM Rules, be subject to
speciﬁc penalties that shall apply to Groundwater Conservation Areas as shall be speciﬁed in the
WRM Rules.
1.1.2 Exclusions and exemptions
(a) Historic use
Historic or existing groundwater use in the GCA before the effective date of the GCA management
guidelines shall be preserved, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with WRM Rules.
Historic use of groundwater may only be preserved for the actual use of the water from the Kikuyu
Spring Aquifer, and cannot be transferred to a different use and may not be withdrawn from a
different aquifer. Therefore, changes in abstraction and use of groundwater under a historic use
operating permit may not be made without prior approval of WRA, and such changes will jeopardize
the historic use preservation. Evidence of historic use must be presented to WRA before such use
may be preserved. Whenever preserved, such use will be regularized by WRA to reﬂect the new
situation under the GCA guidelines.
1.1.3 Transfer of groundwater out of the GCA (a) Permit required
Groundwater produced from a borehole within the GCA may not be transported outside the GCA
boundaries unless the operator has been issued a transfer permit under Rule 48 of WRM rules 2007.
This is to ensure that any water in the aquifer should be used within the conservation area.
(b) Applicability
i. A person proposing to transport groundwater out of the GCA must obtain a transfer permit, in
addition to an abstraction permit for a new borehole, or a transfer permit for an existing one to
transfer groundwater out of the GCA.
ii. A transfer permit for the transportation of water outside the GCA is not required for the
transportation of groundwater that is part of a manufactured product, or the groundwater is to
be used on property that straddles the GCA boundary line, or the groundwater is used within the
existing contiguous service area of an existing retail public utility that straddles the GCA boundary
line.
2.2 Borehole Siting in GCA
Siting of boreholes in the GCA shall be subject to all provisions of the Codes of Practice for Borehole
Siting, with particular regard to Environmental Considerations (Section 5.2). Further to this,
particular emphasis shall be laid to investigation methods (5.4), which shall include an exhaustive
inventory of existing data, including all existing groundwater abstraction in the neighborhood
of the current application without exception. The investigating geologist/ hydrogeologist shall
9The Kikuyu Springs Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Area Management Order (Legal Notice 208 of
2021)  Kenya
demonstrate in the report that this has been exhaustively done for the Technical Evaluation
Committee to consider granting the authorisation to drill.
Conditions for drilling the borehole, including limits to abstraction and mandatory borehole design
considerations shall be stated by the siting geologist/hydrogeologist in his/her recommendations.
In the case of new developments from Kikuyu Springs Groundwater Conservation Area, the
geologist/hydrogeologist’s report will include water balance before and after the proposed
development.
(a) An application for major development within the GCA shall be accompanied by an
environmental impact study that demonstrates that the quality and quantity of groundwater
in the GCA and the recharge function of the area will be protected, improved or restored.
(b) Groundwater use applications that promote storm water management and inﬁltration will
be given priority in granting of authorisations to drill within the GCA. Such plans shall be
subject to approval so that they do not pose groundwater contamination risk.
2.3 Borehole Construction
These guidelines are complementary to the Codes of Practice for Construction of Boreholes and
should be read in conjunction with the following documents:
• The Water Resources Management Rules, 2007
• The Code of Practice for the Siting of Boreholes
• The Code of Practice for the Supervision of Construction of Boreholes
• The Code of Practice for the Test Pumping of Boreholes
• The Water Allocation Guidelines (2010)
2.3.1 Spacing requirements
(a) To minimize as far as practicable the drawdown of the water table and the reduction of
artesian pressure, to prevent interference between boreholes and to prevent degradation of
water quality the Water Resources Management Authority will enforce spacing requirements
on all new boreholes in the GCA. These will be in accordance with the spacing guidelines
outlined in the Section 4.4 of the Water Allocation Guidelines (2010).
(b) Spacing requirements in the GCA do not apply to manually-dug large diameter wells
abstracted by windlass or such traditional systems.
(c) In the case of a municipal well ﬁeld, WRA may waive the spacing requirements on the
well ﬁeld if the applicant submits adequate evidence showing that the increased cone of
depression caused by the well ﬁeld will not increase the impact on nearby existing wells. This
calls for, inter alia , appropriately designed pumping tests and well ﬁeld layout design.
2.3.2 Sanitary seal
The minimum depth of the sanitary seal in boreholes in the GCA shall be 6 metres; the area is a
high-recharge area that has high linear transmissivity along the numerous fault zones. It also has
thick soils that may be subject to piping thereby increasing the risk for groundwater contamination.
2.3.3 Unsuccessful boreholes
Abandoning of unsuccessful boreholes shall be in accordance with the Codes of Practice for
Borehole Construction. In addition to backﬁlling, an abandoned borehole in the GCA shall be sealed
in the top 6 metres to ground level with bentonite.
2.4 Pollution Control
10The Kikuyu Springs Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Area Management Order (Legal Notice 208 of
2021)  Kenya
These guidelines shall be read in conjunction with the provisions of the Water Act (Cap. 372), WRM
Rules, 2007 and such other subsidiary legislations as may be put in place from time to time in
respect to Water Quality and Pollution Control.
Due to the need to prevent pollution in the GCA, upon inspection, WRA may provide notice to
affected parties and issue orders to prevent pollution. If WRA determines that an emergency
situation exists, a temporary order to prohibit pollution and protect public health, safety and
welfare shall be issued without notice. The order shall continue in effect for the lesser of ﬁfteen (15)
days or until tests are done.
2.EXEMPT AND PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES
3.1 Exempt Activities
The following activities are exempt from the GCA requirements:
1. All residential uses and activities;
2. Other uses not listed as prohibited;
3. Activities already permitted and regulated by the Water Resources Management Rules (e.g.,
historic water use).
3.2 Prohibited Activities
The following activities are considered high-impact uses due to the probability and/or potential
magnitude of their adverse effects on groundwater and shall be prohibited in the GCA:
A. Landﬁlls;
B. Large capacity septic systems (serving multiple dwellings or non-residential establishment of 20
or more persons per day); examples include apartment buildings, schools, religious institutions,
ofﬁce, industrial and commercial buildings, shopping malls, train and bus stations, hotels &
restaurants, casinos;
C. Commercial activities that are not connected to an available sanitary sewer system;
D. Agricultural drainage wells (receive irrigation tail waters, other ﬁeld drainage, animal yard,
feedlot, or dairy runoff);
E. Untreated sewage waste disposal wells;
F. Cesspools (serving multiple dwelling or institutions, or other devices that receive wastes and
which must have an open bottom and sometimes have perforated sides); note that many ‘septic’
tanks are actually cesspools due to design;
G. Industrial process water and disposal wells;
H. Motor vehicle waste disposal wells (surface efﬂuent from service stations); I. Surface mining
operations.
J. Activities that would signiﬁcantly reduce the recharge to aquifers; K. Radioactive waste disposal
sites;
3.3 Enforcement
The enforcement of management guidelines and prohibitions shall be in accordance with provisions
of the Water Resources Management Rules 2007 as established by the Water Act, 2002 (Repealed).
These shall include, inter alia , PART VIII - Water Use Charges, entails and additional ﬁve per cent to
the water use charges.
11The Kikuyu Springs Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Area Management Order (Legal Notice 208 of
2021)  Kenya
The itemized prohibited activities shall be notiﬁed to the National Environment Management
Authority (NEMA), the physical planning department and the public works department in each
county affected by the GCA through the gazette notice.
3.GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION MEASURES
4.1 Conservation activities
The following activities will be undertaken to roll out the conservation plan postgazettement—
1. Public awareness campaigns following Gazettement of the GCA.
2. Reconciliation of the water permit database for the GCA with the actual abstraction points to
ensure all existing groundwater abstractions are authorized.
3. Reconciliation of water use with the permit database to capture the actual abstraction against the
permitted abstraction.
4. Review of permits to equitably match water needs with the permitted abstraction. A moratorium
shall be declared for those found to be over-abstracting and their permits regularized to reﬂect the
actual abstraction conditions, as long as the reviewed water use limit has been assessed positively
and the permit revised accordingly.
5. Review of the (Technical Reports) contents of Hydrogeological Assessment Report for borehole
siting in the GCA to include speciﬁc requirements for conservation areas. The revised rules will
give reporting guidance to include deﬁnitions of the recharge/discharge conditions, identify
groundwater/surface water interactions, characterize vulnerability to contamination, and provide
a pre-to-post project water balance analysis and recommendation of appropriate mitigation
measures.
6. Coordination with the County physical planning, agriculture, water, sanitation departments and
NEMA to highlight GCA management guidelines and technical advice on County by-laws where
required.
7. Installation of dedicated monitoring wells for the various aquifer levels in the GCA.
8. Enforcement of WRM Rules and GCA management guidelines.

5Introduction and Background Information
5.1 Introduction
A catchment area is deﬁned as the land from which water naturally ﬂows into a water course. The
status and conditions of a catchment determines the reliability, quantity and quality of its water
yields. A catchment area acts like a water storage facility where during the rains, the vegetation
cover allows the water ample time to percolate deep down and move as a sub-surface ﬂow to
recharge the rivers, springs and ground water storage in both shallow and deep aquifers. This sub-
surface ﬂow is slow resulting in rivers from a well maintained catchment having higher base ﬂows
even during the dry season as well as good water yield from boreholes in the vicinity. In poorly
maintained and degraded catchment, the rainfall results in the rapid surface run-off which is
channelled into the river courses, resulting in ﬂash-ﬂoods and high volumes of suspended solids.
Since there is little storage in such a catchment, the rivers originating from such catchment will not
be able to sustain their base ﬂows during the dry season.
Catchment areas are thus a vital component in water resource management and they should
be formally delineated, gazetted, protected from encroachment and pollution and managed
sustainably to maintain their ecological integrity.
5.1.1 Legal Framework for Catchment Protection:
Because of its nature, environmental management and protection in general and catchment
protection and management in particular falls within the mandate of various institutions.
Catchment protection is therefore, a cross-cutting issue which is spread over several legislations,
which have a bearing on the environment and/or natural resources management. These legislations
include:
viii). Constitution of Kenya, 2010.
Article 62(3) of the Constitution vests these categories of public land on the National Government
in trust for the people of Kenya- all rivers, lakes and other water bodies, the territorial sea, the
exclusive economic zone, the sea bed, the continental shelf and any land between the high and low
water marks. Article 66(1) further provides that the State may regulate the use of any land, or any
interest in or right over any land, in the public interest.
Additionally, Article 69 obligates the State to ensure sustainable exploitation, utilisation,
management and conservation of the environment and natural resources and the equitable sharing
of the accruing beneﬁts. It is also the duty of every person to cooperate with State organs and other
persons to protect and conserve the environment and ensure ecologically sustainable development
and use of natural resources.
The Article 43(1) (d) of the Constitution guarantees every person the right to clean and safe water
in adequate quantities. In order to ensure orderly delivery of this right, the Constitution has
6The Lake Kenyatta Sub Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 209 of 2021)  Kenya
distributed water resources functions to the National Government under the Fourth Schedule. This
is resultant from the provisions of Article 186 which classiﬁes the functions assigned to each level
of government as exclusive, concurrent or residual.
ix). Water Act (Cap. 372)
Section 22 of the Act provides that where the Authority is satisﬁed that in order to conserve a
vulnerable water resources, special measures are necessary to protect a catchment area or part
thereof, it may by order published in the Gazette declare such an area to be a protected area.
The Authority is empowered to impose such requirements, and regulate or prohibit such conduct or
activities, in or in relation to a protected area that the Authority may consider necessary to impose,
regulate or prohibit for the protection of the area and its water resources.
Under Sections 23 of the Act, where the Authority considers it necessary that special measures
are necessary for the conservation of ground water are necessary in the public interest, it may by
public order published in the Gazette, declare the area to be a groundwater conservation area and
impose requirements or prohibit certain activities in relation to a groundwater conservation . The
Authority, in conjunction with relevant institutions and stakeholders, establish management rules
or plans that shall apply to each Protected Area or Groundwater Conservation Area.
x). Water Resources Management Rules 2007
Rule 124 and Part D of the Sixth Schedule to the Water Resources Management Rules 2007, sets out
the contents of Management Plans related to a protected area to include:
(i) Procedures to be applied for the management of the Protected Area or Groundwater
Conservation Area;
(ii) Prohibited activities;
(iii) Any measures required to be undertaken for water resource conservation and
protection;
(iv) The timeframe for implementation of required measures;
(v) Any other conditions that the Authority may consider
Rules 116 to 120 of the Water Resources Management Rules 2007 provides for the determination of
the riparian land, which as deﬁned in Part I of these rules does not imply a change of ownership but
imposes management controls on land use for water resource quality as deﬁned in these rules.
This part deals extensively with the management of the riparian land including its management,
activities that are allowed or proscribed within the riparian land.
The Authority shall undertake Public Consultation with respect to the establishment of areas to be
Protected or designated as Groundwater Conservation Areas and the management rules or plans
that shall apply with respect to these Areas.
5.1.2 Background information on Lake Kenyatta catchment:
Lake Kenyatta is a fresh water Lake found within Mpeketoni Division of Lamu West Sub County,
Lamu County, located 60km to the south west of Lamu Island and 230 km north of Malindi town.
The sub catchment covers an area of 496km2. The sub catchment is under the management of Lake
Kenyatta WRUA.
The sub catchment comprises of natural forest as well as the Lake Kenyatta settlement scheme, a
resettlement programme initiated by the Government in the 1970’s in an area with high agricultural
potential.
Lake Kenyatta is partly fed by rainfall, sub-surface ﬂow and occasionally receives water from Tana
River during ﬂood ﬂows. Water is mainly abstracted through shallow wells and boreholes and is
used for domestic and agricultural purposes. Further, the Lake is considered a vital ground water
recharge area which is important for sustaining the livelihoods of the community in the area.
7The Lake Kenyatta Sub Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 209 of 2021)  Kenya
5.1.3 Rationale for Catchment Protection through Gazettement;
Lake Kenyatta, one of Kenyan’s oldest natural fresh water Lakes, began drying up in 2016,
threatening human and wildlife populations that have for ages depended on it for water supply.
Within a period of one month alone, 15 hippos died and their carcasses were spread on the drying
Lake. The lake has run close to dry in recent years, and dried up completely in 1956 (National
Environment Secretariat, 1985).
At some point, the Lake was completely dry and dotted with shells of millions of dead snails. The
key contributor to the Lake drying up was increased human settlement around the Lake. The water
ways which used to feed the Lake have been interfered with by human activity.
A management plan is therefore critical for the conservation and protection of Lake Kenyatta
catchment area and the aquifers. This will tackle poor land use practices and restoration of the
destroyed catchment area. The management plan will include a catchment investment plan for the
sustainable management of the water resources.
TCA’s CMS (2014 - 2022) recognised the need to protect the lake and increase its environmental
functions. This is anticipated to be achieved through the implementation of the following
strategies:
• Sensitization of the local community on the need to protect the wetland to ensure environmental
sustainability;
• Development of an action plan to protect the catchment and their rehabilitation;
• Participatory mapping of the protection zones around the Lake with the community;
• Apply the law to protect wetland (enforcement for wetlands/riparian/springs protection);
In addition, Part XI of WRM Rules 2007, Rules 123 - 125 sets out the process and procedure for, the
identiﬁcation of an area as a protected or groundwater conservation area. This is the procedure
used in coming up with this Gazettement document for the Lake Kenyatta Sub Catchment.
5.2 Location and size of area to be gazetted
The area identiﬁed for Gazettement is found within Mpeketoni division of Lamu West sub county,
Lamu County, located 60km to the south west from Lamu Island and 230 km north of Malindi town.
The sub catchment covers an area of 41km2 and is within the 4KB-sub basin of Tana Basin Area.

1.2.1 Watershed area;
Lake Kenyatta is partly fed by rainfall, sub-surface ﬂow and occasionally receives water from Tana
River during ﬂood ﬂows. The area that contributes surface run-off into the Lake has been delineated
through the use of a GIS software. The area measures 413.5 square kilometres out of the 10,962.3
km2 catchment area of the whole 4KB sub basin as shown in Fig. 1 below

1.2.2 Physiography, climate and rainfall;
e) Physiography
Mpeketoni area is gently ﬂat from 51ft asl to 5 ft asl towards the shore. Along the shore there
is sand dune ranging from 15 meters asl to 45 meters asl. The chat below shows cross sectional
topography of Mpeketoni area.
f) Geology
The Kenyan coastal environments are set in a passive continental margin, the evolution of which was
initiated by the break-up of the mega continent Gondwanaland in the Lower Mesozoic. The initial opening
of the Indian Ocean was preceded by doming, extensive faulting and down warping similar to that
observed in the modern Great Rift Valley of East Africa. These tectonic movements formed a North-South
trending depositional basin. During the Mesozoic, this basin was exposed to numerous marine incursions
and by the Jurassic, purely marine conditions are thought to have existed.
Geology of the area reﬂects predominantly quaternary history of marine inﬂuence with numerous
transgressions and regressions and associated sedimentary features. It is characterized by lagoonal
deposits, Aeolian accumulation and fossil coral reefs, occasionally dissected by alluvial sediments
g) Hydrogeology
Groundwater forms the main water supply source of fresh water under the Lake Kenyatta Water Users
Association (LAKWUA) for Mpeketoni Town/settlement. The fresh water aquifer is mainly found in the
fossil coral reefs which are present under most of the area. The aquifer is recharged by both deep rainwater
percolation and inﬂow from Lake Kenyatta.
The lateral extent of the fresh water body has been found to be at least 10km2, including fresh water below
the Lake bottom and some below the southern western bank. The depth to the saline/freshwater interface
varies between 20 and 40 metres below surface. The average thickness of the fresh water body is 20 metres.
The fresh water aquifer is mainly found in the fossil coral reefs which are present under most of the area.
The boreholes depths range between 15-18 m depth. Ground Water Survey (K) LTD (1987, 1992) inferred
that the depth to the saline/fresh water interface in Mpeketoni area varies between 20 and 40 metres
below the surface. Within Mpeketoni and its surrounding areas, each household has a well. Most of these
wells have motorized pumps.
h) Soils
The soils are composed of coral limestone overlain by a thin layer of loamy sandy soils.
The Red Loam Soils have the following characteristics:
• Fair organic matter content (humus) in top soil
• Well aerated soils which can hold water for the plants (little leaching)
• Roots do not penetrate so deeply into this soil as in the sandy soils (especially trees)
11The Lake Kenyatta Sub Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 209 of 2021)  Kenya
• Medium fertile soils which respond well to fertilizer applications (can hold nutrients well)
• Due to the high clay content, rain inﬁltrates the soil slowly (water logging). Heavy shows can cause local
run-off
• Best soils for annual crops like cotton, maize, etc.
The humus of the top soil will disappear if no organic matter (plant residues, fallow crop, etc.) is added to
the soil. This will lead to a hard, compacted soil surface which is difﬁcult to cultivate when dry. The hard
soil crust does not permit light showers to enter the soil and the water evaporates quickly on the surface.
The soil loses its fertility if no organic matter is added.
The Sandy Soils
These have the following characteristics:
• Well-drained soils, sometimes excessively drained (leaching of nutrients)
• Low fertility, depending on the organic matter content of the top soil
• Soil (top layer) cannot hold water for the plants
• Soil is easy to cultivate
In most of these soils the clay content increases with increasing depth. That is of advantage for deep
rooting plants like cotton or tree crops during dry spells or insufﬁcient rain. The moisture is stored in or
above the layer with the higher clay content and the deep rooting plants can extract water from there.
i) Hydrology
Lake Kenyatta Sub-Catchment falls under sub basin 4KB which is served by Mukuru River (seasonal), Lakes
Kenyatta and Amu and numerous wetlands which include Pangani, Zebra, Majiglass and Witho.
Mukuru streams drains into Lake Kenyatta however, it has no monitoring station.
To estimate the discharge empirical methods can be used to estimate the discharge. The Lake Kenyatta
catchment is estimated at 41km2 with an estimated annual rainfall of 1000mm (1m).
Therefore, the annual discharge is:
Discharge=area*rainfall per/yr
Taking runoff as 10% of the total precipitation, then
Q=41km2*(1000 * 0.1) mm*e where e=drainage coefﬁcient
Q=41*106m2*(1 * 0.1)m
Q=4.1m3 per/yr
Therefore, Q per month =4.1m3/12= 0.342 m3/Month
j) Climate
Lake Kenyatta sub catchment area lies in the hot tropical region where the weather is inﬂuenced by
the great monsoon winds of the Indian Ocean. Climate and weather systems on the Kenyan coast are
dominated by the large scale pressure systems of the western Indian Ocean and the two distinct monsoon
periods.
From November/December to early March, the Kenyan weather, particularly at the Coast, is dominated
by the Northeast Monsoon (Kazikazi) which is comparatively dry. During March and April, the monsoon
winds blow in an east to south-easterly direction (Kusi) with strong incursions of maritime air from the
Indian Ocean bringing heavy rains. During the months of May, June, July and August, the South-easterly
Monsoon inﬂuence gradually sets in and the weather becomes more stable with dull and comparatively
cooler temperatures. Between September and November, the Northeast Monsoon gradually re-establishes
itself and by December the northern inﬂuence is dominant once again.
12The Lake Kenyatta Sub Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 209 of 2021)  Kenya
The area experiences bimodal rainfall pattern. The long rains come between late March and early June
decreasing from August. Short rain occurs between October and November but decreases rapidly from
December to February. Mean annual total rainfall ranges from 850- 1000 mm. Relative humidity is
comparatively high all the year round, reaching its peak during the wet months of April to July. The mean
minimum and maximum temperature are 22º and 30ºc respectively with potential evaporation ranging
between 2200 and 2400 mm/year (any rainfall station with data?)
Annual rainfall data for the station at Mpeketoni Agricultural Training Centre is shown in the ﬁgure
below. As can be seen the annual rainfall amounts are generally lower than 1000 mm. The annual rainfall
amounts generally depicts a declining trend. The year 2014 had slightly higher amounts than the rest of
the years analysed.
The climate in the area is characterized by two rainy seasons and are distinct dry season from January to
March.
The long rain (March/April-July/August) are followed by occasional coastal showers in August/September
which become heavier during October and head to the short rains in November/December.
The average annual rainfall varies within the sub catchment between 1000-1100 mm/year in Mpeketoni
area.
k) Current land use and its adverse impacts,
The land in the sub catchment is mainly used for farming and settlement purposes.
In addition, agro forestry is in practice.
Subsistence farming include crops like maize, peas, sweet potatoes, cassava, tomatoes and Kales, cashew
nuts, cotton, bananas, coconut, bixa, simsim, mangoes.
The forest coverage in the sub catchment is about 3% which is below the set national standard of 10%,
composed of tree species.
13The Lake Kenyatta Sub Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 209 of 2021)  Kenya
The sub catchment is also characterized by urban settlement which highly depend on ground water
exploitation for water supply for both domestic and irrigation purposes. This water supply is under threat
of pollution from Sea water intrusion, tourism byproducts, efﬂuent from pit latrines, car washing as well
as domestic washing.
Primary forests (coastal rainforests) covering present day Lamu west Sub County remained virtually intact
until the Arabs, Portuguese, Germans and British arrived. Primary forests consist of mangroves along the
coast and further inland, valuable indigenous tree species can be found, such as:
• Afzelia quanzensis (Mbamba koﬁ)
• Brachylaena hutchinsii (Muhugu)
• Chlorophora excels (Mvule)
• Dalbergia melanoxylon (Mpingo).
Like other parts of the coast, that time the area was rich with indigeneous trees including fruit trees such
as Zizyphus mauritiana (Mkunazi) and Dialium orientale (Mpepeta).
It is important to preserve the remnants of the indigenous forests and at the same time plant new trees
and forests. All relevant departments and concerned institutions have to join forces and collaborate in
creating awareness and training of students, local leaders and farmers on subjects such as:
• The dangers and consequences of deforestation
• Environmental conservation and tree planting and
• Protection of valuable indigenous trees and forests
6Current Situation Analysis
6.1 The vulnerability of the water resource
Lake Kenyatta is partly fed by rainfall, sub-surface ﬂow and occasionally receives water from Tana River
during ﬂood ﬂows. Mukuru seasonal streams drains into Lake Kenyatta however, it has no monitoring
station. The Lake is considered a vital ground water recharge area which is important for sustaining the
livelihoods of the community in the area. Water is mainly abstracted through shallow wells and boreholes
and is used for domestic and agricultural purposes.
There may be grounds for concern about over-abstraction in the Lake Kenyatta coral and sand aquifer, for
abstraction of 1,411 m3/d from the aquifers. The aquifer lies close to sea level, and there is a potential
risk of saltwater intrusion. The aquifer is typically 20 m thick, and the fresh-saltwater interface occurs
at depths of 20 to 40 mbgl; static water levels ﬂuctuate seasonally, but are typically <1 to three mamsl.
Properly sited and constructed boreholes are capable of yields of 20 to 30 m3/hr for modest drawdowns (<1
m). Aquifer recharge is largely bank recharge from the seasonal Lake Kenyatta, which has run close to dry
in recent years, and dried up completely in 1956 (National Environment Secretariat, 1985).
Lake Kenyatta aquifer is vulnerable to pollution, due to the high transmissivity of the coral limestone
aquifer.
6.2. The water resource quality objectives and the current status of the water resource
Section 20 of the Water Act (Cap. 372) requires the Authority to prescribe the criteria for classifying
water resources for the purposes of determining water resources quality objectives for each class of water
resource.
The Tana Basin plan developed by WRA in consultation with various stakeholders, Lake Kenyatta sub-
catchment can be classiﬁed as of high economic and social importance. The area has predominantly urban
settlement and/or Agricultural agglomeration areas. This category targets at ensuring quality of water
resources to develop economy and prosperity in urban settlement areas/agricultural centres.
14The Lake Kenyatta Sub Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 209 of 2021)  Kenya
Sustainable water resources management in the sub catchment will focus on cooperation with the
all stakeholders, hence the need to have the interests of residents, farmers and business community
safeguarded.
6.3. The class of the water resource
The Lake Kenyatta sub-catchment can be classiﬁed as “Alarm” as the available water is at not of adequate
quality to meet the demand. The lake Kenyatta aquifer is at the risk of pollution due encroachment of the
catchment area and threat of salt water intrusion.
The table below shows the classiﬁcation of the aquifer according to the Tana Basin plan.

6.4. Land uses and their potential impact on the water resources
The population of Mpeketoni town which is within the catchment area has been growing rapidly over the
years. Being a commercial centre, people from other parts of the country have also being settling there in
search of livelihood activities.
The potential impacts on the water resources as a result of human acts includes:
a. Encroachment: People have encroached waterways, especially in the upper inlet and catchment along
river Mukuru and also along the Lake shore;
b. Overexploitation of available resources: The population in the area has been rapidly growing over the
years. This leads to excessive pressure on available water resources and when abstraction from water wells
exceed the recharge, sea water intrusion into the fresh water is experienced;
c. Catchment degradation: Due to increased demand for sand as a building material, sand harvesting
around the Lake and its catchment has increased. This affects the vegetation and loosens the soil leading
to degradation of the Lake ecosystem;
d. Soil Erosion: Following uncontrolled farming and other human activities, soil erosion leads to siltation
of the Lake hence affecting its overall depth and water levels;
e. Deforestation: The forest cover around the Lake, the immediate catchment areas as well as the wider
catchment has been depleted due human activities. Forests have been cleared to give way for farmlands,
settlements as well as charcoal burning and timber.
f. Water Pollution: Due to excessive economic activities around the Lake, the water has been polluted.
Fishermen do not have sanitation facilities within the Lake leading to open defecation. The farms in
the surrounding area use agro-chemicals which eventually ﬁnd their way into the Lake and leading to
pollution. Other pollutants include solid waste that is washed into the Lake by runoff water during rains.
15The Lake Kenyatta Sub Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 209 of 2021)  Kenya
There is evidence of loss of aquatic organisms. Shells of dead fresh water organisms are found all over the
dry Lake ﬂoor.
7Measures for Conservation and Rehabilitation of the area
Land within the Lake Kenyatta sub catchment and the feeder Mukuru River is legally owned by
Government, local authorities and individuals and this in some instances limits the scope of conservation
regimes that can be applied to the whole basin
7.1 Proscribed Activities;
According to the applicable legal framework as discussed in Sub-Section 1.1.1 above, protected areas
can be used by the neighbouring community in a sustainable manner. The activities to be undertaken
within the protected area are those with zero impact on its ecological status and integrity. The following
activities are speciﬁcally proscribed in a protected area:
xiii). Tillage or cultivation
xiv). Clearing of indigenous trees or vegetation
xv). Building of permanent structures (especially boreholes and houses)
xvi). Disposal of any form of waste
xvii). Excavation of soil or development of quarries
xviii). Planting of exotic species that may have adverse effect to the water resource
7.2 Conservation Plan
The objective of the conservation plan is to protect the long term environmental sustainability of the
catchment for enhanced water resources yield and maintain its ecological functions in terms of ﬂora and
fauna.
In the development of the management programmes, care has been taken to ensure that there are explicit
and logical links between the vision statement, management objectives, and the management strategies
to achieve the objectives. Each management programme is discussed in further detail in the following
sections:
Goals
The overall goals of the management are to:
a) Ensure sustainable management and use of water resources within the sub catchment while promoting
equitable sharing of water resources
b) Ensure the conservation of the catchment areas to improve on the water quantity and quality
Objectives
i). To enhance implementation of existing regulations to protect the rights of all users
ii). To promote water use efﬁciency that is hydrologically and economically beneﬁcial to domestic,
agricultural, and industrial water users and the environment.
iii). To identify funding sources to implement water conservation programs that help to enhance water
resources.

1.5 Introduction and Background Information
4The Lake Ol Bolossat Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 116 of 2023)  Kenya
A catchment area is deﬁned as the land from which water naturally ﬂows into a water course. The status and
conditions of a catchment determines the reliability, quantity and quality of its water yields. A catchment area
acts like a water storage facility where during the rains, the vegetation cover allows the water ample time to
percolate deep down and move as a sub-surface ﬂow to recharge the rivers, springs and ground water storage
in both shallow and deep aquifers. This sub-surface ﬂow is slow resulting in rivers from a well-maintained
catchment having higher base ﬂows even during the dry season as well as good water yield from boreholes in the
vicinity. In poorly maintained and degraded catchment, the rainfall results in the rapid surface run-off which is
channeled into the river courses, resulting in ﬂashﬂoods and high volumes of suspended solids. Since there is
little storage in such a catchment, the rivers originating from such catchment will not be able to sustain their
base ﬂows during the dry season.
Catchment areas are thus a vital component in water resource management and they should be formally
delineated, declared as protected areas by being gazetted as such, protected from encroachment and pollution
and managed sustainably to maintain their ecological integrity.
1.6 Background information on Lake Ol Bolossat
The Lake Ol Bolossat is located at S01o 7’.33"S and 36o 25’4.60"E at an average altitude of 2,340 masl in
Nyandarua County within Engare Narok Melghis Sub Basin Area in drainage area Number 5AA. Its catchment and
lake surface covers an area of approximately 147Km2 and is within the Lake Ol Bolossat WRUA sub catchment. Its
sources of water are from Aberdares ranges mainly from the Nduthi springs among other several springs. It drains
into Engare Narok River at Manguo within Nyahururu Town in Laikipia East Sub-county.
1.7 The lake serves as the main source of water for the Ewaso Narok River and hence contributes to the ﬂow of
Ewaso Ng’iro North River downstream within Laikipia, Samburu, Isiolo and Wajir counties. It is characterized
by different physiological features and diverse species of ﬂora and fauna. One of the peculiar features is that the
lake has both fresh and saline water, and the water does not mix at any one time.
1.8 Its water resources support the livelihoods in ﬁve (5No.) counties namely; Nyandarua, Laikipia, Samburu,
Isiolo and Wajir. It also supports tourism-related activities in these counties including among others the scenic
75m Thomson falls, hotels and globally renowned conservancies such Ol Pajeta and Lewa.
1.9 Lake Ol Bolossat has been identiﬁed as a wetland under the National Government and its land was
demarcated and issued with a Title Deed (LR Nyandarua/Ol Bolossat/482) measuring approximately 14,700
hectares (147 km2 or 36,750 acres).
1.10 Location and size of the Protected Area
The protected area is found within Ndaragwa Sub-county (eastern side) and Ol Joro Orok and Ol Kalau Sub-
counties (western side), Nyandarua County, located 21 km to the south of Nyahururu Town, off the Gil Gil –
Nyahururu Highway and 131 km north of Nairobi City. The sub catchment covers an area of 147 km2 and is within
the 5AA-sub basin of the Ewaso Ngiro North Basin Area.
1.11 Watershed area
Lake Ol Bolossat is partly fed by rainfall, sub-surface ﬂow and springs from the Aberdare ranges to the east of
the lake. The area that contributes surface run-off into the Lake has been delineated through the use of a GIS
software. The area measures 134 km2 out of the 1,357 km2 catchment area of the whole 5AA sub basin.
1.12 Criteria Adopted in Identifying Lake Ol Bolossat for Protection
WRA has taken into account of the considerations provided under the Seventh Schedule of the Water Resources
Regulations, 2021.
5The Lake Ol Bolossat Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 116 of 2023)  Kenya
Part II – PROCEDURES TO BE APPLIED FOR THE MANAGEMENT
OF THE LAKE OL BOLOSSAT CATCHMENT PROTECTION AREA
2.1 Physiography
The Lake Ol’ Bolossat area has gently sloping areas that form part of the Kinangop and Ol’ Kalou/ Ol’ Joro Orok
plateaus. The gentle slopes and plain-like features encourage the formation of marshlands and swamps. The Ol
Bolossat plain was formed through volcanic and faulting activities which gave rise to major land forms; the Great
Rift Valley to the west and Aberdare ranges to the east.
2.2 Further to the west, the land surface is broken by faults forming a complex of shallow horst and graben
structures. The graben in which Lake Ol’ Bolossat lies is bounded by weak faulting on the west, developing
increasingly to the south, and on the east by the Satima Escarpment (36 km-long and 2,500 masl. altitude)
running south from Thomson’s Falls.
2.3 The lake lies at an average altitude of about 2,340 masl. in a wedge-shaped rift valley ﬂoor known as Ongata
Pusi. In the south- east corner of the area, Mount Kipipiri which is part of the Aberdare (Nyandarua) Mountains
is 3,349 masl (Birdlife International, 2017) and 914.4 masl from the Ol’ Bolossat plain, is an isolated volcanic
eminence separated from the Satima massif by the deep cleft of the Wanjohi Valley (McCall, 1967).
2.4 Climate
The Nyahururu climate is largely semi-humid. Lake Ol Bolossat is located in a high-altitude area bordering the
Aberdare ranges. These ranges have a great inﬂuence on the climate of the catchment. The area experiences
very narrow variations in annual temperatures. The rainfall received on the Lake Ol Bolossat side of the ranges is
minimal as it is on the leeward side of the mountain ranges.
2.5 This catchment is within the tropics. Areas within the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer
experiences a bi-modal rainfall regime. This is because of the inﬂuence of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone
(ITCZ). This is a low-pressure belt within the tropics where there is convergence of the northern and southern
trade winds. This has an effect on the rainfall and wind patterns within the areas. These zones experience long
rains during the months of April and June while short rains are experienced during the months of October and
November.
2.6 Rainfall
Rainfall data collected from the AMS Nyahururu rainfall station (ID: 8903068) was used for analysis of the
precipitation received in the area. The station is located within Nyahururu Agricultural ofﬁces in Nyahururu
town. Analysis of rainfall trends is provided in Annexures 2 and 3 of the Second Schedule.
2.7 The rainfall records from the AMS Nyahururu Station indicates that the basin received an average rainfall of
1021 mm over the 17 years record. These rainfall records also indicate that the year 2018 was the wettest year
with a total rainfall amount of 1360 mm. 2019 was the driest year within the time series analysed. The data also
shows that there has been variation in the amount of rainfall received in the basin but the trends have not been
consistent. The past two years have also received rainfall amounts that are below average.
2.8 An analysis of the monthly average rainfall indicated that the month of August has been the wettest over
the years. January is the driest month of the year. The data also shows that the ﬁrst quarter of the year exhibits a
trend of steady in the rainfall amounts received. The average rainfall is between 0.6 and 5 mm per month over the
past 17 years.
2.9 Land Uses and their potential impact on the protected area
According to Lake Ol’ Bolossat Management Plan (2000- 2013), there are several land use practices within and
around the lake. These include agriculture, forestry, ﬁshing, wildlife conservation, mining and infrastructural
development and have been described in details in the subsequent sub-sections. The land use practices have
impacts on the overall ecosystem integrity.
2.10 The Lake Ol’ Bolossat area is a fertile agricultural area classiﬁed as Agro-ecological zone UH3IV with
agriculture, mainly rain fed, being the main land use in Lake Ol’ Bolossat basin and but with several areas under
6The Lake Ol Bolossat Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 116 of 2023)  Kenya
irrigation. Crops grown include maize, beans, wheat, potatoes, pyrethrum and a wide range of vegetables.
Increased horticultural activities especially ﬂower farming in the area have contributed to increase in irrigation
activities around the lake.
2.11 Indigenous forest cover in the area has declined tremendously due to human settlement, deliberate ﬁres
and indiscriminate felling of trees for ﬁrewood and other uses. However; farmers practice agro-forestry and farm
forestry on a limited scale. Key forests around the lake include Ol’ Bolossat Forest, Ndaragwa Forest and Aberdare
Forest.
2.12 The lake still does not support commercial ﬁsheries, but there is subsistence ﬁshing particularly in the
central and southern parts of the lake.
2.13 The lake and its catchment are important for wildlife conservation with a variety of wildlife species that
include hippopotamus, birds, leopard, and small mammals. The encroachment on the riparian reserve has given
rise to human – wildlife conﬂicts.
2.14 There is quarrying sites for the production of building materials mostly on public land and within less
than 100 m from the lake boundaries. These activities are very detrimental to the lake integrity as they result in
siltation of the lake.
2.15 The area around Lake Ol’ Bolossat has witnessed signiﬁcant land-use changes, which are believed to be the
major cause of the dwindling Lake volumes.
2.16 Vulnerability of the water resource
Lake Ol Bolossat is partly fed by rainfall, sub-surface ﬂow and surface ﬂows from springs and streams.
2.17 Due to land use and land cover change in the catchment area, the lake is facing the threat of reduced inﬂows
while at the same time water demand is increasing. Other human activities around the lake and its catchment
area includes—
(a) quarrying;
(b) planting of exotic trees (eucalyptus);
(c) catchment degradation due to intensive land pressure, small plot sizes, and charcoal burning;
(d) soil erosion due to poor farming methods;
(e) encroachment on springs’ sources;
(f)pollution of water resources from agro-chemical;
(g) encroachment on riparian lands and wetlands;
(h) conﬂicts between farmers/wildlife/pastoralists; and
(i) illegal abstraction/poor compliance to water laws.
2.18 The water resource quality objectives
Section 20 of the Act requires the Authority to prescribe the criteria for classifying water resources for the
purposes of determining water resources quality objectives for each class of water resource.
The Resource Quality Objectives represent the desired status of the resource, covering all aspects of quantity,
quality, timing and aquatic biota. The RQO’s are different for different classes of water resource. The objectives
generally relate to the extent to which the water body is allowed to be adversely impacted by water use with
respect to its natural state. Conceptually the RQO’s provide a "target" condition of the resources. Management
decisions should be made such that the condition of the resource is progressively trending towards the RQO. The
status of the resource is a measure of how far the condition of the resource is from the RQO.
The Ewaso Ngiro North Basin Plan developed by WRA in consultation with various stakeholders, has classiﬁed
Lake Ol Bolossat sub-catchment as of high ecological importance. Ecological important areas have almost natural
ecological characteristics. The focus for water resources management is the protection of the natural ecological
characteristics for ecological, recreational and development of tourism with economic importance.
7The Lake Ol Bolossat Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 116 of 2023)  Kenya
Sustainable regional water resources management require co- operation, collaboration and synergy with the
Kenya Forest Service, the Kenya Wildlife Service, National and County Governments MDAs, WRUAs and user
communities.
2.19 The class of the water resource
The present aquifer classiﬁcation system in Kenya is partly demand-oriented and partly geo-political and entails
ﬁve classes:
2.19.1 STRATEGIC aquifers: Aquifers used to supply signiﬁcant amounts/proportions of water to an area where
there are no alternatives, or where alternatives would take time and money to develop.
2.19.2 MAJOR aquifers: High-yielding aquifers with good quality water.
2.19.3 MINOR aquifers: Moderate-yielding aquifers with variable water quality.
2.19.4 POOR aquifers: Low-yielding aquifers with poor to reasonable quality water.
2.19.5 SPECIAL aquifers: Aquifers or parts of aquifers designated ‘special aquifers’ by the WRA.
2.20 Each is further deﬁned in terms of its status, i.e.:
2.20.1 Satisfactory: No immediate stress, pressure or threat.
2.20.2 Alert: Stress, pressure or threat identiﬁed or anticipated.
2.20.3 Alarm: Water levels declining, water quality declining (stress, pressure or threat identiﬁed).
2.21 Land uses and their potential impact on the water resources
The Lake Ol Bolossat sub-catchment can be classiﬁed as "Alert" as the water availability is tending towards
scarcity and is at times not adequate to meet the demand.
2.22 The population around Lake Ol Bolossat which is within the catchment area has been growing rapidly
over the years. Several commercial/trading centres are located within close proximity to the lake and this has
increased the impacts on the lake.
2.23 The potential impacts on the water resources as a result of human acts includes:
(a) Encroachment: People have encroached on springs and waterways.
(b) Overexploitation of available resources: The population in the area has been rapidly growing over the
years. This leads to excessive pressure on available land and water resources leading to encroachment of
the lake catchment and riparian reserve.
(c) Soil Erosion: Following uncontrolled farming and other human activities, soil erosion leads to siltation of
the Lake hence affecting its overall depth and water levels.
(d) Deforestation: The forest cover around the Lake, the immediate catchment areas as well as the wider
catchment has been depleted due human activities. Forests have been cleared to give way for farmlands,
settlements as well as charcoal burning and timber.
(e) Water Pollution: Due to excessive economic activities around the Lake, the water has been polluted. The
farms in the surrounding area use pesticides and herbicides which eventually ﬁnd their way into the Lake
and leading to pollution. Other pollutants include solid waste that is washed into the Lake by runoff water
during rains.

1.5 Introduction and Background information
A catchment area is deﬁned as the land from which water naturally ﬂows into a water course. The status and
conditions of a catchment determines the reliability, quantity and quality of its water yields. A catchment area
acts like a water storage facility where during the rains, the vegetation cover allows the water ample time to
percolate deep down and move as a sub-surface ﬂow to recharge the rivers, springs and ground water storage
in both shallow and deep aquifers. This sub-surface ﬂow is slow resulting in rivers from a well-maintained
catchment having higher base ﬂows even during the dry season as well as good water yield from boreholes in the
vicinity. In poorly maintained and degraded catchment, the rainfall results in the rapid surface run-off which is
channeled into the river courses, resulting in ﬂashﬂoods and high volumes of suspended solids. Since there is
little storage in such a catchment, the rivers originating from such catchment will not be able to sustain their
base ﬂows during the dry season.
Catchment areas are thus a vital component in water resource management, and they should be formally
delineated, declared as protected areas by being gazetted as such, protected from encroachment and pollution
and managed sustainably to maintain their ecological integrity.
1.6 Location and size of the Protected Area
The Lari Swamp (hereafter referred to as the"swamp") traverses three locations namely Lari, Kirenga and
Gituamba of Lari Sub-county in Kiambu County. The swamp is can be seen off Nairobi-Nakuru Highway, a
distance of 2.0 kilometres from Nyambari Town to the right and is accessible from Nyambari Town immediately
past the police station, which is a distance of 2 kilometres from the highway.
1.7 Water shed area
The swamp derived area is 2.447 Km2 or 244.66 hectare as delineated from 1976 Map Sheet 148/1 for Limuru. The
Swamp falls on Bathi River sub catchment.
1.8 Criteria Adopted in Identifying Lari Swamp for Protection
WRA has taken into account of the considerations provided under the Seventh Schedule of the Water Resources
Regulations, 2021.
Part II – PROCEDURES TO BE APPLIED FOR THE MANAGEMENT
OF THE LARI SWAMP CATCHMENT PROTECTED AREA
2.1 Physiography
Lari Swamp’s estimate terrain elevation above sea level is 2348 metres, Latitute: - 1° 1'59.99 Longitude:
36°37'59.99". The physiography of the swamp is characterized by low lying terrain that is characterized by ﬂat,
low-lying terrain that is surrounded by higher ground. The swamp is the source of Ruiru River.
2.2 Climate
The climate of Lari Swamp is generally sub-humid, with average annual precipitation ranging from 800 to 1200
millimetres. The wettest months are typically April and May while the driest months are July through September.
5The Lari Swamp Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 119 of 2023)  Kenya
Temperatures are mild throughout the year, with average highs ranging from 24 to 28 degree Celsius and average
lows ranging 14 to 17 degrees Celsius.
2.3 Rainfall
Continental Rains from July to September when the ITCZ is located north of the equator pulling winds from the
than the Eastern part during this season. Short rains from October to November. Besides the seasonal changes
brought about by the ITCZ,the local topography causes large variations in the climate.
The Annual table is contained under Annexure 2 of the Second Schedule.
2.4 Vegetation
There is both indigenous and exotic vegetation cover in this area, however vegetation in Lari Swamp is largely
inﬂuenced by human activities. Most farmers practice mixed farming, the most dominant vegetation is food
crops for both animal and human consumption, and woodlots. The most popular woodlot trees are the blue gums
present in large quantities.
2.5 Vulnerability of the water resouree.
There is intense agricultural practise and settlements that has led to degradation of Lari Swamp Its riparian and
catchment has been affected by cultivation, livestock grazing, harvesting of indigenous plants and the planting
of exotic tree species that has resulted into reduced recharge into the ground, lowering of the water table and a
decrease in the discharge of the Ruiru river that ﬂows downstream out of the Lari Swamp.
2.6
Lari Sub-county has witnessed increase in population, decline in soil fertility this has made most farmers to
move upland and encroach the swamp. Lari swamp areas is sub-divided into plots. Part of the swamp has been
backﬁlled and proscribed activities are being carried out including building of permanent structures, dumping of
soil, cultivating, planting of exotic trees. Ruiru River has been canalized.
2.7 The water resource quality objectives and the current status of the water resource
Section 20 of the Act requires the Authority to preseribe the criteria for classifying water resources for the
purposes of determining water resources quality objectives for each class of water resource.
The Resource Quality Objectives represent the desired status of the resource, covering all aspects of quantity,
quality, timing and aquatic biota. The RQO’s are different for different classes of water resource. The objectives
generally relate to the extent to which the water body is allowed to be adversely impacted by water use with
respect to its natural state. Conceptually the RQO’s provide a "target" condition of the resources.
Management decisions should be made such that the condition of the resource is progressively trending towards
the RQO. The status of the resource is a measure of how far the condition of the resource is from the RQO.
Initially, RQOs shall be determined at the nodes where the Reserve ﬂows are being determined.
2.8 RQOs shall be determined at the nodes where the reserve ﬂows are being determined.
The focus for water resources management is the protection of the natural ecological characteristics for
ecological, recreational and development of tourism with economic importance. Key water resources issues
include:
(a) Water scarcity.
(b) Catchment degradation.
(c) Erosion.
(d) Legal settlement in riparian areas and swamp and the land tenure around the swamp.
(e) Human activitiesin Lari Swamp affecting the role of swamp.
(f)Illegal and over abstraction
6The Lari Swamp Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 119 of 2023)  Kenya
2.9 Sustainable regional water resources management of these units would require cooperation collaboration and
synergy with the Kenya Forest Service, WRUA, the Kenya Wildlife Service, counties, user communities and other
stakeholders.
2.10 The class of the water resource
The present aquifer classiﬁcation system in Kenya is partly demand-oriented and partly geo-political and entails
ﬁve classes:
2.10.1 STRATEGIC aquifers: Aquifers used to supply signiﬁcant amounts/proportions of water to an area where
there are no alternatives, or where alternatives would take time and money to develop.
2.10.2 MAJOR aquifers: High-yielding aquifers with good quality water.
2.10.3 MINOR aquifers: Moderate-yielding aquifers with variable water quality.
2.10.4 POOR aquifers: Low-yielding aquifers with poor to reasonable quality water.
2.10.5 SPECIAL aquifers: Aquifers or parts of aquifers designated ‘special aquifers’ by the WRA .
2.11 Each is further deﬁned in terms of its status, i.e.:
2.11.1 Satisfactory: No immediate stress, pressure or threat.
2.11.2 Alert: Stress, pressure or threat identiﬁed or anticipated.
2.11.3 Alarm: Water levels declining, water quality declining (stress, pressure or threat identiﬁed).
2.12 The Upper Athi sub-catchment which Lari Swamp falls under can be classiﬁed as "Alert" as the available
water is at times not of adequate quantity and quality to meet the demand. The water availability is relatively
good in terms of quantity and quality in the upper parts of the river but deteriorates as the river ﬂows
downstream due to pollution.
2.13 Land uses and their potential impact on the water resources
The land uses impacts on water resources in Lari includes water pollution due to agricultural chemicals and
fertilisers used in farming, deforestation and soil erosion and changes in precipitation patterns due to climate
change.
2.14 The swamp is continuously being degraded through land reclamation for subsistence agriculture, human
settlement and set up of investments of varying scope and character agricultural activities and settlement.
2.15 The high demand for productive land across and the increasing population in Kenya isevident in Lari Sub-
county. The following are characteristics in different sections of the swamp area:
(a) Locals have title deeds and assert their land ownership.
(b) The swamp area is sub-divided into plots and boundaries erected in some sections.
(c) Ongoing and developed permanent structures.
(d) Draining of the swamp by digging of canals to reclaim land for agriculture.
(e) Grazing of livestock such as dairy cattle, lambs, goats.
(f)Growing of exotic trees species such as blue gum.
(g) Dumping of red soil to reclaim land for settlement.

Part III – MEASURES FOR PROTECTION, CONSERVATION AND
REHABILITATION OF THE LARI SWAMP CATCHMENT PROTECTION AREA
3.1 Proscribed Activities
The activities to be undertaken within the protected area are tho se with zero impact on its ecological status and
integrity.
The following activities are hereby speciﬁcally prohibited in the protected area—
(i) tillage or cultivation;
(ii) clearing of indigenous trees or vegetation;
(iii) building of permanent structures (especially boreholes and houses);
(iv) disposal of any form of waste;
(v) excavation of soil or development of quarries;
(vi) planting of exotic species that may have adverse effect to the water resource; and
(vii) land reclamation.
3.2 Conservation Plan
The objective of the conservation plan is to protect the long-term environmental sustainability of the catchment
for enhanced water resources yield and maintain its ecological functions in terms of ﬂora and fauna.This will be
achieved through—
(i) demarcation of the wetland and its riparian zone and fence it off;
(ii) gazettement of the swamp as a protected water catchment area;
(iii) enforcement of the Lari Swamp management plan; and
(iv) control water resources abstraction from the swamp.
In the development of the management programmes, care has been taken to ensure that there are explicit and
logical links between the vision statement, management objectives, and the management strategies to achieve
the objectives. Each management programme is discussed in further detail under Plan contained under Annexure
3 of the Second Schedule.
3.3 Rehabilitation Plan
The objective of the rehabilitation plan is to ensure the wetland achieves its optimal performance level. This will
be achieved through—
(a) removal of all inappropriate/invasive species of plants;
(b) re-vegetation of the swamp with water friendly/native species of trees and vegetation; and
(c) development of alternative livelihoods to discourage farming within the swamp.
The Rehabilitation Plan is contained under Annexure 4 of the Second Schedule.
3.4 Catchment and Water Resources Monitoring
The objective of the monitoring plan is to collect and analyse catchment and water resources data to provide
information on water discharge, water quality and catchment health as a response to human activities within the
neighbourhood. This will be achieved through:
(a) Upgrading of the Uplands rainfall station to a fully telemetric hydro-meteorological station to monitor
precipitation, evaporation, humidity and temperature.
8The Lari Swamp Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 119 of 2023)  Kenya
3.5 Establishment and operationalization of management structure
The objective of the management structure is to ensure that the Lari swamp catchment protected area
is managed in a sustainable manner with the involvement of all stakeholders under the leadership and
coordination of WRA - ABA. This plan envisages a budget of Kes 42,450,000 to implement it in the medium term
(approximately 5 years). The management will need to raise the funds through various activities and events. This
will be achieved through—
(a) setting up the management structure with deﬁned ToRs and mandates; and
(b) development and implementation of resource mobilization strategies to raise funds for the management
and conservation of the protected area.
Operationalization of the management structure shall be as set out under Annexure 5 of the Second Schedule;
3.6 WRA as the agent of the National Government in the regulation of use and management of water resources,
will be the coordinator of the committee. The members appointed to the Management Committee will serve on
honorary basis as this will be a not for proﬁt, non-commercial venture. The Committee will be required to solicit
for funding from well-wishers and other sources to supplement the income that may be derived from activities
permitted in a protected area.
The linkages between various stakeholders are represented under Annexure 6 of the Second Schedule. The arrows
indicate the direction of ﬂow of information. The dotted lines indicate WRUA can also communicate directly to

Mwangea Hills Catchment Protected Area.
4The Mwangea Hills Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 118 of 2023)  Kenya
1.4 Objectives
The objectives of this Plan are to:
(i) To enhance implementation of existing regulations to protect the rights of all users.
(ii) To promote water, use efﬁciency that is hydrologically and economically beneﬁcial to domestic,
agricultural, and industrial water users and the environment.
(iii) To identify funding sources to implement water conservation programs that help to enhance water
resources.
1.5 Introduction and Background information
A catchment area is deﬁned as the land from which water naturally ﬂows into a water course. The status
and conditions of a catchment determines the reliability, quantity and quality of its water yields. A
catchment area acts like a water storage facility where during the rains, the vegetation cover allows the
water ample time to percolate deep down and move as a sub-surface ﬂow to recharge the rivers, springs
and ground water storage in both shallow and deep aquifers. This sub-surface ﬂow is slow resulting in
rivers from a well-maintained catchment having higher base ﬂows even during the dry season as well as
good water yield from boreholes in the vicinity. In poorly maintained and degraded catchment, the rainfall
results in the rapid surface run-off which is channeled into the river courses, resulting in ﬂashﬂoods and
high volumes of suspended solids. Since there is little storage in such a catchment, the rivers originating
from such catchment will not be able to sustain their base ﬂows during the dry season.
Catchment areas are thus a vital component in water resource management, and they should be formally
delineated, declared as protected areas by being gazetted as such, protected from encroachment and
pollution and managed sustainably to maintain their ecological integrity.
1.6 Location and size of the Protected Area
Mwangea Hills catchment area is located within Kiliﬁ County in the coastal region. It is within the
jurisdictions of Mwangea Jilore and Wachivu; covering Makongeni, Mwahera, Makobeni, Lango Baya,
Jilore/Ziani and Rare/Dida sub locations and Chakama, Mwahera and Lango Baya locations, within
Magarini, Ganze and Malindi sub-counties of Kiliﬁ County.
The catchment covers an area of 24,684 ha and is within the 3LA and 3HD1 hydrological sub basins of Athi
Basin Area.
1.7 Watershed area
The Mwangea Hills lies within the Galana and Goshi sub catchment which are part of the Athi Basin
Area. All the rivers and streams are seasonal; ﬁlling and ﬂowing only during the rainy season. These
include: Katangani, Kazi ya Kawimbi, Kwamunga, Kwalango, Midugani, Kabuuni Mwahera, Kadzitsoni and
Kwadadu. These Rivers and streams ﬂow to Gosh/Vitengeni River to the South and Galana/Sabaki to the
North of the Hills.
1.8 Criteria Adopted in Identifying Mwangea Hills for Protection
WRA has taken into account of the considerations provided under the Seventh Schedule of the Water
Resources Regulations, 2021.
Part II – PROCEDURES TO BE APPLIED FOR THE MANAGEMENT
OF THE MWANGEA HILLS CATCHMENT PROTECTED AREA
2.1 Physiography
Mwangea Hills is situated near Mlombo and the Ikanga with the peak marked by a point with coordinates
37M 0580173, 9640814 (E039.721625, S03.249372) and at an elevation of 625 m.a.s.l. Mwangea Hills Water
Tower is one of the coastal ecosystems and lies within the Galana and Goshi sub-catchments which are
5The Mwangea Hills Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 118 of 2023)  Kenya
part of the Athi Basin. All the rivers and streams are seasonal, draining into two major rivers: Sabaki and
Vitengeni.
2.2 Climate
The climate around Mwangea Hills area is tropical with signiﬁcant warm annual temperatures that ranges
between 30°C and 34°C. Kiliﬁ County experiences relatively low wind speeds ranging between 4.8 km/hr
and 12 km/hr.
2.3 Rainfall
The Mwangea Hills experience signiﬁcant amount of rainfall during the year, the average annual rainfall
for Mwangea Hills being 300mm.
2.4 Vulnerability of the water resource
Mwangea Hills Catchment falls under sub basin 3HD1 and 3LA which is drained by the earlier stated rivers
that supports the social-economic and environmental ecosystems.
2.5 Mwangea Hills is an important water catchment area that is a source of several rivers and source of
water for the communities. The hill is not protected and due to its rich soils with readily available water
resources, it has attracted human activities that include cultivation, harvesting of trees for charcoal/wood
fuel as well as human settlement. This unsustainable approach to the water resources abstraction and
catchment management is threatening the survival of the rivers emanating from the hills.
2.6 The water resource quality objectives and the current status of the water resource
Section 20 of the Act requires the Authority to prescribe the criteria for classifying water resources for the
purposes of determining water resources quality objectives for each class of water resource.
The Resource Quality Objectives represent the desired status of the resource, covering all aspects of
quantity, quality, timing and aquatic biota. The RQO’s are different for different classes of water resource.
The objectives generally relate to the extent to which the water body is allowed to be adversely impacted
by water use with respect to its natural state. Conceptually the RQO’s provide a “target” condition of the
resources. Management decisions should be made such that the condition of the resource is progressively
trending towards the RQO. The status of the resource is a measure of how far the condition of the resource
is from the RQO. RQOs shall be determined at the nodes where the Reserve ﬂows are being determined.
2.7 Sustainable regional water resources management of these units would require cooperation collaboration
and synergy with the Kenya Forest Service, WRUA, the Kenya Wildlife Service, counties, user communities
and other stakeholders.
2.8 The class of the water resource
The present aquifer classiﬁcation system in Kenya is partly demand-oriented and partly geo-political and
entails ﬁve classes:
2.8.1 STRATEGIC aquifers: aquifers used to supply signiﬁcant amounts/proportions of water to an area
where there are no alternatives, or where alternatives would take time and money to develop
2.8.2 MAJOR aquifers: high-yielding aquifers with good quality water
2.8.3 MINOR aquifers: moderate-yielding aquifers with variable water quality
2.8.4 POOR aquifers: low-yielding aquifers with poor to reasonable quality water
2.8.5 SPECIAL aquifers: aquifers or parts of aquifers designated ‘special aquifers' by the WRA
2.9 Each is further deﬁned in terms of its status, i.e.:
2.9.1 Satisfactory: no immediate stress, pressure or threat
2.9.2 Alert: stress, pressure or threat identiﬁed or anticipated
2.9.3 Alarm: water levels declining, water quality declining (stress, pressure or threat identiﬁed).
6The Mwangea Hills Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 118 of 2023)  Kenya
2.10 The Mwangea Hills catchment can be classiﬁed as “Alert” as the available water is at not of adequate
quality and quantity to meet the demand. The Mwangea Hills catchment area is at the risk of pollution due
encroachment of the catchment area for anthropogenic activities.
2.11 Land uses and their potential impact on the water resources
The area around Mwangea Hills is predominantly rural settlement with the main land use being
cultivation and rearing of livestock. The potential impacts on the water resources as a result of human acts
includes:
(a) Encroachment: People have encroached on water catchment and riparian reserves areas in the
upper and middle parts of the catchment.
(b) Overexploitation of available resources: The population in the area has been rapidly growing
over the years. This leads to excessive pressure on available natural resources that includes water
resources leading to potential water use conﬂicts.
(c) Soil Erosion: Following uncontrolled farming and other human activities, soil erosion leads to
siltation and loss of top soil cover.
(d) Deforestation: The forest cover around the hill, the immediate catchment areas as well as the
wider catchment has been depleted due human activities. Forests have been cleared to give way for
farmlands, settlements as well as charcoal burning and timber.
(e) Water Pollution: Due to excessive economic activities around the hill, the water has been polluted.
The farms in the surrounding area use agro-chemicals which eventually ﬁnd their way into the
rivers and leading to pollution. Other pollutants include solid waste that is washed into the rivers
by runoff water during rains.
2.12 Exotic species of plants: There exist numerous exotic species of trees which are unsuitable in a water
catchment area, especially near wetland, which include the eucalyptus trees.
3.1 Proscribed Activities
The activities to be undertaken within the protected area are those with zero impact on its ecological
status and integrity.
The following activities are hereby speciﬁcally prohibited in the protected area:
(i) Tillage or cultivation.
(ii) Clearing of indigenous trees or vegetation.
(iii) Building of permanent structures (especially boreholes and houses).
(iv) Disposal of any form of waste.
(v) Excavation of soil or development of quarries.
(vi) Planting of exotic species that may have adverse effect to the water resource.
(vii) Land reclamation.
Part III – MEASURES FOR PROTECTION, CONSERVATION AND
REHABILITATION OF THE MWANGEA HILLS CATCHMENT PROTECTION AREA
3.2 Catchment Protection Plan
The objective of the conservation plan is to protect the long-term environmental sustainability of the
catchment for enhanced water resources yield and maintain its ecological functions in terms of ﬂora and
fauna. This will be achieved through:
(a) Sensitization on catchment management.
7The Mwangea Hills Catchment Protection Area Order, 2023 (Legal Notice 118 of 2023)  Kenya
(b) Revegetation of the catchment area which includes indigenous and water friendly plant
propagation and exotic species control.
(c) Water storage enhancement to ease pressure on use of rivers water which includes rain water
harvesting tanks and water pans.
(d) Regulating activities that may lead to pollution and destruction of the eco-system (Charcoal
burning, over-grazing, cultivation, quarrying and sand harvesting).
(e) Controlling abstraction limits and observing of safe yields.
(f)Controlling encroachment and cancellation of illegal titles.
Each management programme is discussed in further detail under Plan contained under Annexure 1 of the
Second Schedule.
3.3 Conservation Plan
The objective of the conservation plan is to protect the long-term environmental sustainability of the
catchment for enhanced water resources yield and maintain its ecological functions in terms of ﬂora and
fauna.
In the development of the management programmes, care has been taken to ensure that there are explicit
and logical links between the vision statement, management objectives, and the management strategies to
achieve the objectives
The Conservation Plan is contained under Annexure 2 of the Second Schedule.
3.4 Catchment Monitoring Plan
The objective of the catchment monitoring plan is to collect water resources data and maintain a
comprehensive database on the Mwangea hills that provides information on water levels and quality of the
spring’s water. This will be achieved through:
(a) Establishing and implementing a water quality and pollution control plan.
(b) Water sampling and analysis.
(c) Establish a water resources database.
(d) Reporting and appropriate interventions.
The Catchment and water resources Monitoring Plan is contained under Annexure 3 of the Second
Schedule.
3.5 Establishment and operationalization of management structure
The objective of the management structure is to ensure that the Mwangea Hills catchment protected area
is managed in a sustainable manner with the involvement of all stakeholders under the leadership and co-
ordination of WRA - ABA. This will be achieved through—
(a) setting up the management structure with deﬁned ToRs and mandates; and
(b) development of resources mobilization strategies to raise funds for operations, maintenance and
conservation of the protected areas.
Operationalization of the management structure shall be as set out under Annexure 4 of the Second
Schedule.
3.5 WRA as the agent of the National Government in the regulation of use and management of water
resources, will be the coordinator of the committee. The members appointed to the Management
Committee will serve on honorary basis as this will be a not for proﬁt, non-commercial venture. The
Committee will be required to solicit for funding from well-wishers and other sources to supplement the
income that may be derived from activities permitted in a protected area.

NGARELEN SPRINGS CATCHMENT CONSERVATION PROTECTION GUIDELINES
Foreword
Generally, the main problems and concerns relate to accommodating increasing water demands on the springs
while maintaining and protecting the ability of the springs to support human and environmental needs in a
sustainable manner. The unprotected catchment makes the springs highly vulnerable to contamination from
sources such as, but not limited to efﬂuent from solid waste, animal droppings, agro-chemicals used in farming
and silt as a result of agricultural activities. Loss of vegetation cover over it may lead to higher evaporation rates
compromising the spring’s storage.
The Ngareleen Springs Catchment Protection Guidelines as presented encompasses four plans that are further
expounded in the document to achieve the goals of sustainability of the Ngarelen springs catchment; Water Use
Plan, Monitoring Plan, Springs Protection Plan, Conservation/Protection Plan and Monitoring Plan.

1. Introduction and Background Information
1.1. Introduction
A catchment area is deﬁned as the land from which water naturally ﬂows into a watercourse. The status and
conditions of a catchment determines the reliability, quantity and quality of its water yields. A catchment area
acts like a water storage facility where during the rains, the vegetation cover allows the water ample time to

is little storage in such a catchment, the rivers originating from such catchment will not be able to sustain their
base ﬂows during the dry season. Catchment areas are thus a vital component in water resource management
and they should be formally delineated, gazetted, protected from encroachment and pollution and managed
sustainably to maintain their ecological integrity.
1.2. Legal Background
(i) Constitution of Kenya
Constitution of Kenya recognizes water as a human right and confers to every person the right to clean and
safe water in adequate quantities in a clean and healthy environment. Consequently, water resources has
drawn national attention where it has been recognized as being essential in making the country become
industrialized in accordance to the Kenya’s Vision 2030, a blue print for the national development agenda
for Kenya.
5The Ngarelen Springs Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 207 of 2021)  Kenya
Article 66 of the constitution deals with land and provides that the State may regulate the use of any land,
or any interest in or right over any land, in the public interest.
Section 69 deals with the environment and natural resources including the sustainable exploitation,
utilization, management and conservation and the equitable sharing of the accruing beneﬁts. It is also
the duty of every person to co-operate with State organs and other persons to protect and conserve the
environment and ensure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources.
(ii) Water Act (Cap. 372)
Section 22(1)
Provides that where the Authority is satisﬁed that in order to conserve a vulnerable water resource, special
measures are necessary for the protection of catchment area or part thereof, it may, by order published in
the Gazette  declare such a catchment area to be a protected area.
Section 22(2)
Provides that the Authority may impose such requirements, or regulate or prohibit such conduct or
activities, in or in relation to a protected area as the Authority may consider necessary to impose, regulate
or prohibit for the protection of the catchment area and its water resources.
(iii) Water Resources Management Rules 2007
Part X1 section 123-126 provides for protected areas and groundwater conservation areas including
management guidelines related to a protected area or a ground water conservation area.
The Authority shall also undertake Public Consultation with respect to the establishment of areas to be
Protected and the management rules or plans that shall apply with respect to these Areas.

1.3. Location and Size of Area to be gazetted
Rombo is sparsely populated and is entirely considered to be in a rural set up. The Ngarelen Springs mainly
serve the residents of Rombo and Njukini sub locations in Rombo Location. The total population in the two
sub locations is 10,728 people (KNBS Census Data). The springs are the sole source of water for the residents
of the area for domestic use, livestock watering and subsistence and commercial irrigation. Due to livestock
grazing and the residents drawing water directly from the springs, there has been degradation on the riparian
areas. Currently the springs are tapped via intakes to support irrigation agriculture, which is the main economic
mainstay of the community in Rombo. Encroachment of the spring’s area for settlement and agricultural
activities has led to the general degradation of the catchment area.
6The Ngarelen Springs Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 207 of 2021)  Kenya
This proposal for the gazettement of the Ngarelen Springs catchment area will entail clear delineation of the
boundaries of the catchment and preparation of a catchment protection plan among other activities. This will
prevent encroachment of the catchment area by the residents. The encroachment of the spring catchment area
has paved way for settlement, grazing on the catchment and cutting down trees for charcoal burning. Prevention
of further degradation of the springs catchment will guarantee enough and reliable water for both irrigation and
domestic use throughout the year. This can be achieved through gazettement of the catchment.
The Ngareleen Springs Catchment Conservation Protection Guidelines Goals are to ensure springs protection and
conservation as well as sustainable use of the water resources.
Ngarelen Springs are located within Nalepo WRUA Sub Catchment in Rombo Location, Rombo Division
of Loitoktok Sub County in Kajiado County, about ﬁve hundred (500) metres from Rombo Township. The
spring forms parts of the tributary of Rombo and Tsavo Rivers and is part of the 3G Drainage Area. The spring
catchment area of approximately 15 acres (60,703m2) is public land. However the land is not demarcated and
there are individuals who have encroached into the land and put up structures and carried out agricultural
activities. Livestock also regularly encroaches into the catchment when grazing and in need for water.
The springs are located as shown below.
Fig.3. Location Map of Ngarelen Spring within Nalepo sub catchment
Due to degradation of the spring catchment, protection works was carried by Water Resources Authority in 2019.
This involved the construction of a masonry wall around the spring eye, placement of gabions on the upstream of
the spring and planting of suitable tree seedlings within the spring catchment. This resulted in an increase in the
yield of the spring. Pollution of the source by livestock watering from the spring source has also been eliminated.
Gazettement of the catchment will lead to further improvements. Prior to this, the average daily gauge height at
RGS 3GA02 was 0.12 m. After the construction of the masonry wall, this ﬁgure has steadily increased to 0.20m.
The ﬁnal available discharge value available is 0.151 m3/s on 3rd May 2019.
7The Ngarelen Springs Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 207 of 2021)  Kenya
To ensure proper conservation and protection of the Ngarelen Spring Catchment, WRA, community and other
key stakeholders recognised the need for Gazettement of the land.
ACA’s CMS (2014 - 2022) has recognised the need to protect the catchment areas and increase their
environmental functions. This will be achieved through the implementation of the following strategies:
• Sensitization of the local community on the need to protect the catchment areas to ensure environmental
sustainability;
• Development of an action plan to protect the catchment and their rehabilitation;
• Participatory mapping of the protection zones around the water catchments with the community;
• Apply the law to protect catchment areas (enforcement for wetlands/riparian/springs protection);
In addition, Part XI of WRM Rules, Rules 123 - 125 sets out the process and procedure for the identiﬁcation of
an area as a protected or groundwater conservation area. This procedure will be used in coming up with the
Gazettement documents for the Ngarelen Springs Catchment.
Climate
The area belongs to the sub-tropical semi-arid climatic zone. The average annual temperature is 22.7oC, with
the lowest in the months of July – August (20.4oC) and the highest in the month of March (24.9oC). The annual
rain distribution shows two pronounced rainy seasons, namely the long rains from March to May and the short
rains from November to December. The mean annual rainfall is about 526 mm. The highest mean monthly
precipitation occurs in April (122.1 mm) and the lowest is in July (2.7mm).
Geology and Physiography
The soils of the area are primarily developed from undifferentiated volcanic rocks (predominantly pumice) of the
Rombo series of the Tertiary age. Physiographically, the area forms part of the general and extensive piedmont
plain, which extends from the foot slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, to the Pare Mountains in the South East. The area is
generally ﬂat (slope 1-2%) but is studded with numerous small parasitic cones (hills) and plugs, which rise above
the general level of the plain.
Hydrology
Ngarelen Springs are among a number of springs in the sub catchment that ﬂow into tributaries that form Rombo
River and ﬁnally ﬂow into Tsavo River.

Vegetation
The natural vegetation of the area is mainly wooded, bushes, grassland with acacia tree bushes and shrubs
and tall perennial grasses. However, irrigated agriculture has largely replaced this natural vegetation with
smallholder maize, tomatoes, and onions among the crops grown.
Erosion in the catchment
A notable feature in the area is that owing to the relatively ﬂat terrain that is mostly bare and the volcanic soils
that are susceptible to erosion, several gullies have developed as the fast ﬂowing water from the vast springs and
Mt Kilimanjaro ﬂow past the area. The soils in the sub catchment comprise of deep clay and clay whose depth is
unknown. The upper and mid zones of the sub-catchment is dominated by deep clay. The lower section of the
sub-catchment is characterized by clay of unknown depths
Indeed, the area upstream of Ngarelen Springs is characterized by a deep gulley that was initially transporting
loads of silt to the spring’s area. For this reason, protective gabions were constructed on the upstream side of the
spring with funds from WRA.
Springs water quality
The quality of water from Ngarelen springs can be described as good. According to analysis of water samples
from the springs by the WRA Central Water Testing Laboratory in September 2019, the water was considered as
chemically ﬁt for domestic use. However, there is danger of contaminating the spring’s waters due the human
activities currently being undertaken within the catchment area, if intervention measures are not implemented
immediately.
Catchment Issues/ Challenges
9The Ngarelen Springs Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 207 of 2021)  Kenya
The main problems and concerns relate to accommodating increasing water demands on the springs while
maintaining and protecting the ability of the springs to support human and environmental needs in a sustainable
manner. The unprotected catchment makes the springs highly vulnerable to contamination from sources such as,
but not limited to efﬂuent from solid waste, animal droppings and silt as a result of agricultural activities. Loss of
vegetation cover over it may lead to higher evaporation rates compromising the spring’s storage.
Currently the main concerns affecting abstraction of water from the springs include:
• Depletion of fresh water resources
• Effects on water sources used by the local communities i.e. contamination.
• Effects on natural vegetation (forest cover) and agricultural land use.
Vegetation Clearing
The vegetation clearing causes direct exposure of springs to evaporation impacting on the springs yield. In
addition, vegetation slows down the rain drops as they fall to the ground, giving more time for the water to
inﬁltrate into the ground and recharge the springs. At the same time, the vegetation cover reduces the speed and
hence impact of the raindrops as they hit the ground, which loosens the soils, causing erosion. The springs need
to be re-vegetated and cutting of trees in the catchment area should be stopped forth with.
Climate Change
The vagaries of climate change like everywhere else has meant that there are more depressed rainfall than usual.
The catchment area and the surrounding areas experience recurrent droughts leading to frequent water use
conﬂicts among farmers and pastoralists who use water from the Ngarelen springs.
2. Current Situation Analysis
2.1 Vulnerability of the Water Resources
Ngarelen Springs have a Regular Gauging Station 3GA02 located at coordinates. Latitude E 037041'35.5",
Longitude S 030 03’ 07.7" at an elevation of 1157 m.a.s.l and approximately 500m downstream of the spring. The
daily water levels is available. The last discharge data available is from May 2019 (0.151m3/s).
In terms of geology the area comprises a series of volcanic layers associated with Mt. Kilimanjaro namely Kijabe-
type basalts and dense olivine basalts.
Groundwater occurrence in this area can be described as poor, the dense basalts, Kijabe type basalts and
melanocratic basalts are massive and not faulted, this implies porosity is poor and don’t support storage of
groundwater. However, the areas along River Rombo present good condition for groundwater occurrence, in
addition the area east of the sub catchment indicates presence of old land surface contact point between gneiss
and basalts which may have productive aquifer
Water Resources Quality Objectives and the Status of the Water Resource
According to the ACA CMS (2014 - 2022) Ngarelen Spring catchment area within the Nalepo sub-catchment can
be classiﬁed as of medium Commercial importance. The area is predominantly rural. Economic activities include
farming, livestock keeping, wildlife, and tourism. This category targets at ensuring quality of water resources to
develop economy and prosperity for the residents and all other stakeholders who use the water. Sustainable water
resources management in the sub catchment will focus on cooperation with the all stakeholders, hence the need
to have the interests of residents, small scale /large-scale farmers, pastoralists and wildlife safeguarded.
2.3 Class of the water resource
The Ngarelen Springs catchment is located within Nalepo sub catchment and can be classiﬁed as "Alert" since
the available water is at times especially during the dry season of adequate quantity to meet the demands
from the various competing uses. The water quality at the source and in the upstream areas is good, however it
deteriorates as the stream ﬂows downstream due to contamination from the grazing and agricultural activities.
2.4 Land Uses and their potential impact on water resources
10The Ngarelen Springs Catchment Conservation Area Order (Legal Notice 207 of 2021)  Kenya
With the inﬂux of farming over the years, there have been signiﬁcant land use changes. Large areas hitherto used
as range lands were opened for farming thereby affecting land cover.
Nalepo sub catchment has witnessed extensive land use change since independence of Kenya in 1963. These
changes represent the response of the population to local and exogenous opportunities and constraints.
This area has experienced rapid and extensive land use change in response to a variety of economic, cultural,
political, institutional and demographic processes. The community within sub catchment is changing from
livestock keeping as their main livelihood activity to irrigated agriculture. This has caused severe environmental
degradation (deforestation, encroachment of riparian land) leading to pollution of water sources by agro
chemicals, liquid and solid wastes.
Poor methods of water use such as open canals and ﬂooding have caused people to shift to new areas hence,
more degradation of the sub catchment. The riverine vegetation along the river channels and/or near springs
and other water sources has been cleared to give way to farmlands. These changes have intensiﬁed as a result of
human population growth.
3. Measures for Conservation and Rehabilitation of the area
3.1 Prescribed Activities;
According to the relevant legal framework as discussed above, protected areas can be used by the neighboring
community in a sustainable manner. The activities to be undertaken within the protected area are those with
zero impact on its ecological status and integrity. The following activities are speciﬁcally proscribed in a
protected area:
vii). Tillage or cultivation
viii). Clearing of indigenous trees or vegetation
ix). Building of permanent structures (especially boreholes and houses)
x). Disposal of any form of waste
xi). Excavation of soil or development of quarries
xii). Planting of exotic species that may have adverse effect to the water resource
3.2 Water Use Plan
The objective of this water use plan is to protect the long term water storage and supply capacity of the springs
by controlling encroachment and degradation of the catchment.

FOURTH SCHEDULE [r. 17(1)]
CALCULATION OF PREMIUM
PREMIUMS FOR USE OF WATER FROM A REGULATED WATERCOURSE ETC.
In the case of a permit to abstract or divert water from a regulated river, a premium shall be paid by the water
user which shall calculated using the formula herein:
**(0 & M) + 20% x allocation to individual water user in MCM/year =
Annual Design Yield of Storage Dam in MCM/year; Kshs per year**
Where:
1. (O&M) is the Water Storage Authority’s or proponent’s operation and maintenance costs of the dam
releasing the water into the natural watercourse from which abstraction or diversion occurs.
2. The allocation to individual water user is the water allocated by the permit to the individual water user in
cubic metres per year.
3. Annual design yield is the design yield of the storage dam releasing into the regulated river in cubic metres
per year.
4. The formula provides the basis for deriving the amount payable by the water user as a premium.
