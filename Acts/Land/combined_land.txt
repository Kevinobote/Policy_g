67.Consent by lessor to application by lessee under lease

(a) transfer or assign the lease;
(b) enter into a sublease;
(c) part with possession of the leased land or buildings;

unreasonably withheld if the lessor as a condition of or in relation to the giving of consent—

or other consideration for the consent, other than the payment of the lessor’s reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with the giving of consent;

If a sublessor surrenders the head lease to the owner or merges the head lease with the land out of which
it was created, the owner of the land shall have all the same remedies against the sublessee for non-
performance or non-observation of the covenants and conditions expressed or implied in the sublease and

intention, expressly or impliedly, appears from the lease, or from any other circumstance—
(a) the obligations imposed on the lessor by covenant of the lease run with the reversion and
may be enforced by the person who is from time to time entitled to the reversion;
(b) the rights to the beneﬁts of every covenant imposed on the lessee, that refers to the subject
matter of the lease, may be exercised and enforced by the person who is from time to time
entitled to the reversion against the person who is from time to time entitled to the lease.
(2) A person who becomes entitled to exercise a right to which subsection (1)(b) refers may exercise the
right even if it ﬁrst became exercisable or accrued before the time at which that person became so
entitled unless before that time, the right was waived or the lessee was released from the obligation
to which the right relates.
(3) If, in respect of a lease—
(a) there has been a division of the reversion into different parts so that different persons are
lessors of the different parts; or

the obligations referred to in subsection (1)(a) and the rights and remedies referred to in subsection
(1)(b) shall be apportioned, and to the extent required by that apportionment, remain attached
to each part of that reversion or to that part of the land in respect of which the lease has not been
terminated as the case may require and may be enforced by the person entitled to enforce those
obligations under subsection (1)(a) and exercised by the person entitled to exercise those rights and
remedies under subsection (1)(b).
70. Effect of payment by lessee to assignor of reversion
(1) If a lessor has transferred or assigned the reversion, any payment by the lessee of any part of
the rent or of any other money due under the lease to the transferor or assignor shall discharge
the lessee to the extent of that payment unless the lessee had actual notice of the transfer or
assignment before making the payment.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in any other written law, the registration of a
transfer of the reversion shall not, for purposes of subsection (1), in itself, be an actual notice to the
lessee of the transfer.

71. Transferor or assignor of lease released from liability to pay rent and observe
covenants thereafter
(1) In respect of any lease or any transfer or assignment of a lease or part of it made or coming into
effect on or after the date of the commencement of this Act—

personal covenant to the lessor for payment of rent and for all breaches of covenants,
notwithstanding that the transferor or assignor is no longer in possession or occupation of
the leased land, shall cease to apply; and
(b) the effect of a transfer or assignment of a lease is, as from that date, to discharge absolutely
and without more the transferor or assignor from any obligation to pay rent or to observe
any covenants in respect of the land as from the date of the transfer or assignment, whether
the person to whom the lease has been transferred or assigned is in or goes immediately into
occupation or possession of the land so transferred or assigned.
(2) As long as the transferor or assignor remains in occupation of the leased land and notwithstanding
the transfer or assignment, that transferor or assignor shall remain liable to pay rent and comply
with all the covenants as if the person were still the lessee for as long as the person shall remain in
occupation.
(3) Subsection (1) shall not absolve a transferor or assignor of a lease from any obligation to pay rent
or remedy and breach of a covenant that accrued or arose during the term of the lease when that
transferor or assignor was bound by all the covenants in that lease and the lessor may enforce all
such obligations of that lease that have so accrued or arisen against that transferor or assignor
notwithstanding that the lease has been transferred or assigned.
(4) As from the date of the commencement of this Act—
(a) the rule of common law that a lessee remains liable to pay rent and comply with all the
covenants notwithstanding that the lessee has, with the agreement of the lessor, vacated the
leased land before the date for the termination of the lease, shall cease to apply; and
(b) subsection (5) shall forthwith apply.
(5) A lessee who, with the agreement of the lessor, vacates land before the termination of a lease shall
remain liable to pay rent and observe all the covenants in the lease for one year from the date on
which the lessee vacates the land or buildings, unless the lease provides expressly for a shorter
period, and if the lessor leases that land or any buildings to another person before the end of one
year, the provisions of subsection (1) shall apply, with effect from the date of the execution of that
lease.
(6) Subsection (1) shall not absolve a lessee to whom subsection (5) applies, from any obligation to pay
rent or remedy a breach of a covenant that accrued or arose during the term of the lease when that
lessee was bound by all the covenants in that lease and the lessor may enforce all such obligations
of that lease that have accrued or arisen against that lessee notwithstanding the fact that the lessee
has vacated the land.
(7) The provisions of subsections (1) and (5) shall apply in a similar manner to the transfer, or
assignment of a lease of a part of the leased land and to the vacating of a part of the leased land as
they apply to the transfer of assignment of the lease of all the land and the vacating of all the land
comprised in the lease.
(8) Any term expressed or implied in a lease or in a condition or covenant in a lease that is in conﬂict
with this section shall be void.

(a) exercised, where neither the lessee nor any person claiming through or under him is in
occupation of the land, by entering upon and remaining in possession of the land; or
(b) enforced by action in the court.
(3) The acceptance by the lessor of any rent after the service of a notice of forfeiture under section 75
does not operate as a waiver of the lessor’s right of forfeiture unless the lessor has by any other
positive act shown an intention to treat the lease as subsisting.
74. Effect of forfeiture on subleases
The forfeiture of a lease determines every sublease and every other interest appearing in the register
relating to that lease, but—
(a) where the forfeiture is set aside by the court on the grounds that it was procured by the lessor in
fraud of the sublesee; or
(b) where the court grants relief against the forfeiture under section 76, every such sublease and other
interest shall be deemed not to have determined.
31Land Act (Cap. 280)  Kenya
75. Notice before forfeiture
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the lease, no lessor shall be entitled to exercise the
right of forfeiture for the breach of any agreement or condition in the lease, whether expressed or implied,
until the lessor has served on the lessee a notice of not less than thirty days—
(a) specifying the particular breach complained of; and
(b) if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the breach within such reasonable
period as is speciﬁed in the notice; and
(c) in any case other than non-payment of rent, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money
for the breach,
and the lessee has failed to remedy the breach within thirty days thereafter, if it is capable of remedy, and
to make reasonable compensation in money.

(1) A lessee upon whom a notice has been served under section 75, or against whom the lessor is
proceeding, by action or re-entry, to enforce his right of forfeiture, may apply to the court for relief;
and the court may grant or refuse relief, as the court, having regard to the proceedings and the
conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case, thinks ﬁt, and, if it grants relief, may grant
it on such terms as it thinks ﬁt.
(2) The court, on application by any person claiming as sublesee or chargee any interest in the property
or part of the property comprised in the lease forfeited or sought to be forfeited, may make an order
vesting the property or such part in such sublesee or chargee for the whole period of the lease or
any less period, upon such conditions as the court in the circumstances of the case thinks ﬁt:
Provided that nothing in this subsection shall apply in the case of a forfeiture arising from a breach
to which the sublesee is a party, or from the breach of an express agreement or condition against
subleasing, parting with the possession of or disposing of the property leased.
(3) This section shall have effect notwithstanding any stipulation or agreement to the contrary and
whether the lease is registered or not.
77.Unlawful eviction
(1) A lessee who is evicted from the whole or a part of the leased land or buildings, contrary to the
express or implied terms and conditions of a lease, shall be immediately relieved of all obligation to

on the part of the lessee expressed or implied in the lease in respect of the land or buildings or part
thereof from which the lessee has been so evicted.
(2) For purposes of this section, a lessee shall be considered as having been evicted from the whole or
part of the leased land or buildings, if, on the commencement of the lease, the lessee is unable to
obtain possession of the land or buildings or part thereof, as a result of any action or non-action of
the lessor or any of the lessor’s agents or employees, contrary to the express or implied terms of the
lease:
Provided that a lessee who is aggrieved as a result of unlawful eviction under this section may
commence an action against the lessor for remedies.

104. Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs
(1) In considering whether to grant relief as applied for, a court—

agricultural land or commercial premises, and the remedy proposed is to appoint a receiver,
or to take possession of or lease the land or a part thereof;
(b) shall, where the charged land consists of or includes, a dwelling- house, and the remedy
proposed is to appoint a receiver, or take possession or lease the dwelling house or a part of
it, have regard to the effect that the appointment of a receiver or the taking of possession
or leasing the whole or a part of the dwelling house would have on the occupation of the
dwelling house by the chargor and dependants and if the effect would be to impose undue
disturbance on those owners, whether it is satisﬁed that—

remedies, to induce the chargor to comply with the obligations under the charge; and
(ii) the chargor has persistently been in default of the obligations under the charge; and

operation of a remedy that the circumstances of the case require and without limiting the
generality of those powers, may—
(a) cancel, vary, suspend or postpone the order for any period which the court thinks reasonable;
(b) extend the period of time for compliance by the chargor with a notice served under section
90;
47Land Act (Cap. 280)  Kenya
(c) substitute a different remedy or the one applied for or proposed by the chargee or a different
time for taking or desisting form taking any action speciﬁed by the lessor in a notice served
under section 90;
(d) authorise or approve the remedy applied for or proposed by the chargee, notwithstanding
that some procedural errors took place during the making of any notices served in
connection with that remedy if the court is satisﬁed that—
(i) the chargor or other person applying for relief was made fully aware of the action
required to be taken under or in connection with the remedy; and
(ii) no injustice will be done by authorising or approving the remedy, and may authorise
or approve that remedy on any conditions as to expenses, damages, compensation or
any other relevant matter as the court thinks ﬁt.
(3) If under the terms of a charge, the chargor is entitled or is to be permitted to pay the principal sum
secured by the charge by installments or otherwise to defer payment of it in whole or in part but
provision is also made in the charge instrument or any collateral agreement for earlier payment
of the whole sum in the event of any default by the chargor or of a demand by the chargee or
otherwise, then for purposes of this section the court may treat as due under the charge in respect
of the principal sum secured and of interest on it only the amounts that the chargor would have
expected to be required to pay if there had been no such provision for earlier payment.
(4) A court may at any time before the charged property is sold refuse to authorise or approve a remedy
if it appears to the court that—
(a) the default in issue has been remedied;
(b) the threat to the security has been removed;
(c) the chargor has taken the steps that the chargor was required to take by the notice served
under section 90; and

These Regulations may be cited as the Land (Assessment of Just Compensation) Rules.
2.Interpretation
In these Rules unless the context states otherwise requires—
“market value” means the value of the land at the date of publication in the Gazette  of the notice of
intention to acquire the land.
3.Factors to be considered in the assessment of compensation
The Commission shall consider the following factors when assessing compensation—
(a) the market value of the land;
(b) damage sustained or likely to be sustained by persons interested at the time of the Commission's
taking possession of the land by reason of severing the land from his or her other land;
(c) damage sustained or likely to be sustained by persons interested at the time of the Commission's
taking possession of the land by reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting his or her other
property, whether moveable or immovable, in any other manner or his or her actual earnings;
(d) reasonable expenses incidental to the relocation any of the persons interested or who will be
compelled to change residence or place of business as a consequence of the acquisition; and
(e) damage genuinely resulting from diminution of the proﬁts of the land between the date of
publication in the Gazette  of the notice of intention to acquire the land and the date the
Commission takes possession of the land.
4.Assessment of market value
(1) The Commission shall determine an award based on the market value of the land to be acquired.
(2) When assessing the market value—
(a) the commission shall take into consideration the effect of any express or implied condition
of title or law which restricts the use to which the land concerned maybe put;
(b) if the market value of the land has been increased, or is currently increased, in either of the
following ways, the increase shall be disregarded—
(i) an increase by reason of an improvement by the owner or his or her predecessor after
the date of publication in the Gazette  of the notice of intention to acquire the land; or
1The Land (Assessment of Just Compensation) Rules (Legal Notice 283 of 2017)  Kenya
(ii) an increase by reason of the use of the land or premises in a manner which could be
restrained by a court or is contrary to the law, or is detrimental to the health of the
occupiers of the premises or to public health.
5.Factors not to be considered in the determination of an award
In determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for land acquired under the Act, the
Commission shall not consider—
(a) the degree of urgency which has led to acquisition;
(b) any disinclination of the person interested to part with the land;
(c) damage sustained by the person interested which, if caused by a private person, would not be a
good cause of action;
(d) damage which is likely to be caused to the land after the date of publication in the gazette  of the
notice of intention to acquire the land or in consequence of the use to which the land will be put;
(e) any increase in the actual value of the land as at the date of publication in the Gazette  of the notice
of intention to acquire likely to accrue from the use to which the land will be put when acquired;
and
(f)any outlay on additions or improvement to the land, incurred after the date of publication in the
Gazette  of the notice of intention to acquire land, unless the additions or improvements were
necessary for the maintenance of any building in proper state of repair.
6.Additional compensation
The Commission shall add a sum equal to ﬁfteen per cent of the market value to the amount of
compensation as compensation for disturbance.
